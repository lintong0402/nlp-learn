You know what I do is write for children, and, in fact, I'm probably the author for children, more read in the U.S.
And I always tell people I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> as a farmer, or with leather <unk> and no one has chosen a farmer.
Today I'm here to talk to you today about circles and <unk>
And you know that a epiphany is usually something that fell into the place.
You just have to turn the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of a complicated kind of circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle school in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare <unk>
When she was just beating every week in the bathroom of the kids, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life for letting me go into the bathroom of the teachers.
He did it in secret it.
for three years.
And I had to go out of the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the 1920s, I felt the need to start working on organizations fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call from that <unk> <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm sure that adults have never been to know us.
You could take it to Ohio and please bring that man to you that you have ever found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to leave you with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we were <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found her one place, the <unk> and the fire and the <unk> of his family, because I was necessary, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman I wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a <unk> box in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had been closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you was done in itself in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
And so she saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that I was talking about this today.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was amazed.
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I would sell them to me around the water <unk> almost 60 feet, and I couldn't even think of it as a <unk> on another <unk> on another <unk> year after year.
<unk> are born when they fall from the glaciers or you break on the ice shelves, or you break on the ice.
Each iceberg has their own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to give up and hold up to the end, while others can't get more and <unk> in a <unk> passion <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> who are isolated apart from each other, as we see ourselves as a human.
But reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> I'm breathing out its ancestral atmosphere.
As a iceberg, a eardrum is released fresh water in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments exist in that way, and they will never exist in that way again.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of their way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> I photograph is very <unk> it has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice is over 100,000 years.
The last photos I'd like to show you are from an iceberg I photographed at <unk> Greenland.
It's little frequent really going to get to see an iceberg on the iceberg, <unk>
Here you go.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your <unk> line.
You can see here, it starts <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing up there.
This is an iceberg of average size.
<unk> of water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same moment, every single <unk> OK.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to go too much in the details of the conception, because if they stop thinking about the conception of it, I'm not going to pay attention to me.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm is joined the X chromosome from the <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome is joined the X chromosome from the <unk>
Both of them, and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my ground activity to play two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the history of anatomy.
I'm a training for training, and what I study in this case is the way people started by anatomy -- that mean, human bodies and <unk> how they've considered the body fluids the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, as a <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working, for example, with fraternal twins, two people inside one body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average average.
And I've worked with a lot of cases of people with sex with individuals whose physics -- physics doesn't fit in the male <unk> male <unk>
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> takes many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways to have sex that are not going to be <unk> in the common forms or female.
For example, there is the case of the individual <unk> <unk> whose gene <unk> the chromosome comes from the chromosome and tells the <unk> that we all have in the life that we all have in <unk> life.
And then, in <unk> life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, the body doesn't respond to the same.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there are higher levels of testosterone but no reaction.
As a consequence, the body develops on the way that the body typically <unk>
When he <unk> the baby looks like a child.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when you're growing up and developing the breast but it doesn't have the menstrual period when someone realizes something is going on.
And then you do test tests realize that instead of having ovaries, and <unk> it actually has testicles and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's not really like this.
Women, like men, we have in the body called <unk> glands called <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I think a <unk> woman doesn't know his <unk> structure, I think being a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to <unk>
<unk> <unk> and respond to the <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> <unk> to <unk>
So sex is something complicated. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some ways they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I received a call from a 19-year-old and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and sex with her, he was wearing a life as a guy and he had just figured out he had ovaries, and <unk>
I had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had 20th chromosomes and the uterus -- the <unk> glands were so active that, in essence, created a male hormone setting.
As a consequence, the genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk> nothing.
And it was at the age of 19 when he started to have the medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors found that, in fact, it was women in the inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with 20th chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> to say, they have tissue <unk> wrapped in tissue <unk>
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies are -- because they're <unk> fraternal twins, or <unk> <unk> to surgery, is not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why it comes to several surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is usually based on the idea that a particular anatomy has <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have <unk> <unk> <unk> being black wants to have African anatomy in historical terms.
Very simplistic idea.
And when you get a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very dramatic ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of <unk> very romantic.
Imagine the amazing thing that is having children who are born like two people inside one body.
The recent case is the last year of last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> put in <unk> their sex on the <unk> <unk>
A lot of reporters called to wonder: "What are you going to do to determine whether you're <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the reporters that you have no test.
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't traces a <unk> line between men and women or men and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> are we who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more it goes forward, the more we have to admit that these <unk> categories -- we thought they were a stable legal categories that were <unk> directly to <unk> <unk> categories are much more <unk> than they <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that turns out much more complicated than the terminology of <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What do we <unk> from the fact that they are just a few <unk>
And as we thrive in science we get more and more in an awkward area where we have to recognize that <unk> categories are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to get a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, not in public, but I know within <unk> when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors had never had to stand with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of a lot would put a pen in front of the nose and he moved on not to do it.
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract some vital organs from a body and put them on another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with a dilemma of determining somebody's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm a progressive, I'm <unk> to people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that you put a little nervous.
I think these categories are much more fragile than we thought about <unk>
So let's move from the point of view of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, that I find out every single thing watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not by music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> were, for me, the first activists in the anatomy and tell you why.
What they were doing, was a <unk> concept and <unk> it with another which was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And, as you all remember, what <unk> our <unk> <unk> was the idea of <unk> the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue.
They were from the idea that the political power was coming to the right power of the blood from the grandfather to the father and then the son, etc.
The <unk> <unk> rejected that idea and replacing it by a new concept -- and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the <unk> differences. That was very radical.
And in part they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
And it was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it's very clear, if you look at the story of the <unk> <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a world <unk>
They were <unk> out of the explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to be passed from a kind of vague right idea of a <unk>
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of Independence and talk about nature and the god of nature.
Don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in consequence we were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing that, they were rejected by the foundations of Human Rights movement.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happened next?
And the women <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights Movement with people from <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men at the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I am a man."
And again, some of the people that are going to <unk> the coincidence of coincidence about the difference -- and again, <unk>
We see the same with the Movement of <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish to a human rights than a human.
I don't want to say that we should engage ourselves in front of anatomy.
I don't want to say that at the age of five years, they should be allowed to have sex or to get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that to me make sense and that I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two sentient beings at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before I was time: June 1, 1980.
How about the other hand, was born in term: was born March March 1980.
For the only fact that we were born three months before Mary were attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to sexual consent, sexual consent, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because it was born afterwards.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
So Henry, at virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> by virtue of being considered a man now -- a man now is <unk> <unk> <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, for your hand, doesn't have the same rights to marriage who Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So we still have <unk> categories that in various aspects are <unk> and <unk>
And now the question is, what do we do now that science went so much in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on anatomy could <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It looks like what happens in our culture is sort of a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a rare position.
For example, Texas at a certain time has decided that to marry a man you don't have to have chromosome and to marry a woman you have to have Y.
Now, in practice they don't make tests for the people.
But this is also very strange given the story that I told you at the beginning of the <unk> syndrome.
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I love <unk> "I offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people judge not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea seems enough.
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be able to hold it into this to provide rights to people, because I've never admit that I know some of the social services that probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent decisions and <unk> about their sexual relations that people from 40 than I know.
So how do we put the issue of content from <unk>
It's very difficult.
And a part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI.
We really want to get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current job of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context as the Iranian man that a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being killed -- unless he's willing to have a change of sex, in which case it is allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like the one that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had made to give birth twins <unk> to then pick them up, and then they <unk> their name.
But when the phone asked her for the reason for the operation, I was able to make a very <unk> operation -- he said that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
And I said, "Well, he's considered the political asylum instead of <unk> <unk>
The United States offers enormous possibilities to people to be who are <unk> to change for the sake of the state.
So I think we need to be on the head.
Well, to end up I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy would be, or as it might have been, if we had given more participation to <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and that is that I think there can be different ideas coming from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about a group.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in looking for sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know from studying studies is that women, on average, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers I knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I considered a feminist, as a <unk> I made a <unk>
<unk> what about female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with getting rid of getting rid of gender, so there's nothing female in the <unk>
But the more I thought about the question, the more I thought is that there is anything female in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different from the women's brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So while the <unk> were very aware to find the way we protect people in the state of the state, it's possible to have become more <unk> to this concept, we might have enriched the concept of protection with your support support.
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we explore democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect force, let's think about what we do about each other.
Thank you.
In the year 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family think about where you want to go to live and work, and have the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, right now, we're far from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't tell a single town to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth more than their building cost.
So we could easily <unk> the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you never thought about new cities.
But they just run out of the apartments.
Imagine that half that they wanted to live in apartments already were owners and that the other half is still stopping to do that.
They could try to increase the capacity by doing <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas surrounding them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the distractions for construction.
So it would be very hard to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a totally new, new place, to build a whole new apartment building -- always and when the rules of that place will build up building <unk>
So I proposed that governments are <unk> new big reform zones to contain cities and gave them a name, under <unk> cities.
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year around 75,000 pounds of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened by a constitutional crisis.
In the next regular election, <unk> <unk> was shaped by a platform in which a nonprofit reforms and at the same reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of tests with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to its most essential.
The first point was the importance of norms, as those rules that say that you can't go and contribute to all the current residents of apartments.
We have a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies as the rules for <unk> and usually it's the rules that keep us going forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him a link to the TEDTalk.
I showed it to <unk>
They called me up.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities, much more valuable than its cost <unk>
And he used this image that shows the value of the land in a place like New York <unk> which in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract argument, and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
And the talk was describing in very simple terms, which is a <unk> city is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a charter that <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and an option so people can choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> I called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way our country forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I'd talk again about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot value of a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport just covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that was going to be at least 1,000 miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the TEDTalk.
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the TEDTalk.
And this was explaining to it, that a new city can offer new options for people.
There would be an option of a city that could be able to be in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away to the North Pole.
And also new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government -- they would need help from countries -- they would be able to benefit from countries that they could benefit from countries that will help them to establish and make the norms of the <unk> so that they all could trust that the <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and saw one site.
This picture is from there.
It could be easily about a thousand square miles.
And shortly after, 19 on January, voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that would allow these special <unk>
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis in Congress in favor of this constitutional constitutional <unk> to one.
All the <unk> all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
To <unk> in the <unk> you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17, he passed over again on another voting from <unk> to one.
Immediately after the vote of 21 to 24 of February, a delegation of about 30 <unk> was the two places in the world that are most interested in participating in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new major city center that is building in Korea is bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years and getting the <unk>
The other country in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical, this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and you're thinking about a site for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> <unk> and eventually to be able to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allowing her to be the Supreme Court for this new <unk> system.
There are urban planners and builders of cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that they have already solved is that they have a good number of residents.
There are a lot of companies that wanted to be installed in <unk> especially in a place with a free trade, and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately another place.
There's a million a year coming out of Latin America to go to the United States.
A lot of them are parents who have to leave the back of their family to go to get a job, sometimes they are mothers who have to make money for just eating or buy clothes.
Sadly, sometimes there are even kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what seems to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all around the world?
What seems to be thinking about insist so that families can choose between several cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends were asked to say, "Thank you <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there are inside, I'm going to make a <unk> and is that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, and I was more recently to photograph and post in my blog and <unk> and colorful and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets.
Ah, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to meet people -- usually my money goes to a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be from my size?
<unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I won.
Back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I was going to do for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings to someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I do?"
I've brought seven pairs of underwear and nothing else.
Put it inside to exactly a week that's all I've put in my <unk>
I imagined that I would be able to find everything else I'd like to use after I was here to Palm <unk>
And because they don't know me as a woman walking at TED in <unk>   that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
While I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons that I believe or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this tiger tiger brilliant.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You almost always see you phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including the <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've ever used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost impossible to be bad enough, when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
Just yourself.
If you get rid of the right people -- not just <unk> you will give you a <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child in the inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the <unk> or I remember them to a little of seven years.
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the key.
If you think you look good at something, it's almost safe you are.
And if you think you don't look good at something, it's probably going to be true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your interior and outside, you don't see you <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth for you: The golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style -- and it's a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it over and over again when people approached me this week just so I was using it, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously all this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, and I'm going to give it all.
Because the lesson that I'm trying to learn this week is that we have to leave some things.
I don't need to be emotionally emotionally emotionally to these things, because at the end of the corner, there will always be another crazy, <unk> <unk> and a little bit of love in my heart and I'm after.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left side, which is the logic and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of every single <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So, where do you make your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something that is -- with a great <unk> in both sides at the same time.
It's not that it's mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, which just like most of the other quantum physicists, <unk> we need pretty much kind of logic to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We can play with them and then we see as a <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
<unk> intuition that you may have developed with the step of the years is the one that says that one thing can be just a place at a time.
I mean, it might sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a small kid and he didn't do it very well, it always <unk>
But I bet that playing with that parking bar parking lot taught it a valuable lesson, and is that the big things don't allow the <unk> to stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you will be a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play parking bars and play with these strange particles.
And when they play with your particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really rare things -- like you can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point that was the physics some years -- you needed to describe quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That's not very good at my intuition, and maybe it's because we don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it also didn't be <unk> to my logic.
Because if it's all made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't all follow the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason I shouldn't should.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object is also following the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see that has been in a overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the piece of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's right at the center.
And then here we do a very big approach to the little metal <unk>
What we see is a little piece of metal with a springboard and that <unk> in a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way that you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip, and I put all the big machines around about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this <unk> <unk> <unk> which is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but for it it needs some help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people come up with them I stop doing those things, because I don't want to get it to you, or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
Now, the journey of inanimate objects are not just people, but it's also the light that <unk> and the wind that happens to their side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this piece of metal to behave according to the quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then <unk> a <unk> and pulled out all the air, and then you put it into a temperature of less than a degree above zero at all.
Now, when you're just going to be only in the <unk> the little metal piece is free to act like it.
So we measure their movements.
We discovered that they moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, and the way that I was born, it was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> which expands and <unk>
And when you give it a soft drive, we could make it <unk> and that I don't get to <unk> at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you about is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing, and you didn't play it at the same time?
Let's think of atoms.
In one case, all of the trillion atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Really.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years -- because, watch this, the difference on a scale between one atom and that piece of metal is more or less the same as the difference between that piece of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece can be in two different places, why not you too?
I mean, it's my logic that I talk about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be?
How do your consciousness act if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we did it, and we turned the lights up and looked inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in a single piece.
And I was able to get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects in the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about a lot about that quantum mechanics is saying that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so <unk>
It's more profound.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago I was doing another job in Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head that's here and allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months.
So many stories and stories, we did it with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did it.
I think my own story is explaining simply to this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, began to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
We'd better show you the demo, then to explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've carried out from their launch.
So, <unk> we're going to <unk>
Look around all the museums there.
There's the gallery, <unk> <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, to <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are in the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and they <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We opened the top, and with one click, we jumped in.
They're inside that they want to go at the end of the hall,
Come forward. That is <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign there.
If the museum shows us the picture, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we have captured in what we call technology <unk>
So this picture, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million <unk>
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10,000 million <unk>
You can zoom around in a very simple way.
You see funny things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to get to <unk>
So I started play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
I came up and found that the kids were actually playing something.
So I talked to a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is on hit a <unk> with a stick in the Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper into the depth and you'll see it really can be even the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to pull the image, so you'll see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
It's better for coming, a second.
So now we're going to quickly jump at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what happens if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh is actually created by this <unk>
It enhances it and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts on this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> I think I had never seen it as well before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are lots of things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can come online to create their own museum itself, to create their own collection of all these images.
It's very easy, we walked -- I've created this function that I call "The <unk> power -- we just made a zooming around.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, you send her friends and keep a conversation about what they feel at contemplating these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main things is that all amazing things really do not come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they even don't come from museums either.
Maybe I should not say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that has been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium is doing justice to their artwork and that is represented properly online.
And the big question I'm doing today is, "You do this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening.
I have something to show you.
Think of it a <unk> a flying pixel ...
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture, I'm from Italian, all the children in Italy are growing up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that there has been some very interesting things on <unk> careers in the last two decades.
Some time ago, if you wanted to win a career of <unk> one, take a budget and put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, one made the career.
This is what that is, in engineering, they were <unk> in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now, what's interesting today is that today's control systems are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're getting <unk>
And as <unk> are starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note note -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and even 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be something big.
More than cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> for late year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it's kind of like almost all of all the atoms that are coming back and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end took the hammer and he threw it into the Moses -- you can still see a little bit of a <unk> <unk> and said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just about <unk> insisting on the idea of getting the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is really one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer of <unk>
It was the year in which Italy won the World Cup in the World.
Maybe some of the things -- they were playing Italy and France, and at the end of it, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end he won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at <unk> activity.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The timeline.
On the late evening, there are people over here and there making <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people make a quick call and go to the bathroom.
Second <unk> End of time.
First <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
<unk> Italy, yeah!
That night all went to <unk> at the center.
There you see the big summit.
The next day they were all to the center of the meeting and the prime minister at the time.
And then everybody goes down.
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the time <unk> people will <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way we wouldn't have done a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> it's not about people, but what we use and we consume.
Today, we know all about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, -- how do you <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project we developed a little bit small tags to track the trash in its shift through the system.
We started with some volunteers that helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year ago, to label what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that we all have to do with.
Then we put a little chip, a tag on the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
After a week.
With this information we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same thing with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're happening complicated things and there's a lot of no need.
But the other thing we believe is that if you look at every day that the cup that we <unk> is not still somewhere on the planet.
If the bottle of plastic we put a day still goes down there.
And if we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detection and many other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part we talked about at the beginning, which is <unk>
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all began with a question of the mayor of the city that came and told us that Spain and said that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of the water in public space.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, to join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop was, imagine that they have a <unk> and <unk> tubes of <unk> <unk> that open and <unk>
It creates a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If you go down the pixels you can write on them, show patterns, images, images.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open so that we can actually happen, as you see in the picture.
We presented this to the mayor of <unk>
He liked it a lot.
And I added a commission to design the building to the entrance to the <unk>
We call it a <unk> <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There are no doors or windows, but when you're coming up to this is open for you to be able to happen.
The ceiling is also covered with water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you go down the roof.
Or you can close the building and the whole architecture disappears, like this case.
Those days, there will always be somebody, in the winter, when the ceiling, someone who was there and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it goes down almost all the architecture goes away.
This is how it works.
It looks at people who are going on to what happens in.
And here I'm myself trying not to be able to try and test the sensors that open up the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was really even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way they interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let me happen, but a building that was still doing <unk> and holes and you had to jump to <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because we architects, engineers, designers, always think about the use that people will give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels the pixels of water, and of projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine you could have small helicopters in the air, and each one had a small pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that's moving in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, as we saw before, which is moving with others in sync.
Could we form this cloud,
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal <unk> configuration.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, where it changes is light, not the position of the <unk>
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine the screen appear on different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in which you can get close to you, and you can see it from very different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light turns on the light, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have every pixel with a input that comes from people, from the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of <unk> from today, the star from the New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their 3D movement and use them as input to <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left side, you see the <unk> capture in different <unk>
It's so much 3D <unk> as a movement capture.
It can <unk> the whole movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could get people to get people to do something and change our <unk> environment, like a <unk> farm as <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make it just a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we spend the physical world to the digital world.
We've got everything, as knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign -- we can pass it from the digital world, of the power of the networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions -- how to move from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the actual cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but covered in <unk>
You can move inside, having different experiences.
You can see from below, to serve the main moments of the Olympics of 2012 and even more, and it can be used as a way of connection to the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are?
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in their genes, they could improve the <unk> by more accurate and more fast.
Or maybe you would like to be in a better way, to get more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and secure from ourselves?
What about living with good health?
Or maybe they're from those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is it that they most <unk>
What would you like if you could choose anything?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
How many people do we do creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> probably got to the number of creative creative people present.
That's very good.
How many of you want memory?

And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Ah, most of you. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this that the world would be very different.
It's just imagination?
Or maybe be possible?
Evolution has been a theme here at the TED Conference. But today I want to give you a little doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> which also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote a trial titled <unk> in biology, it makes sense except for the light of <unk>
But if you effectively accept biological evolution consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
It refers to others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well on one end, it is, of course, the most interest of us.
<unk> from a common ancestry with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years.
In the moment, there have been maybe 20 to 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem like we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is roughly the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of the human insulin protein that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, which is the same protein, which comes out of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all take in the gut -- more bacteria that the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- you know, when Antonio <unk> would take you out of the <unk> you think about <unk>
The gut is an amazing environment for those bacteria.
It's warm black, <unk> it's very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that they can want to have no effort from their part.
It's really like a fast way for bacteria with a occasional <unk> of some rush to the way out.
But for that, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They actually help digest nutrients <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what is the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or it meant to become something different, something maybe <unk> <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe, the life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, like one single one and a single human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you have <unk>
When I was just <unk> at college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental about most of the existence of life, in the majority of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms, each cell is simply splitting and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters cells.
But when the organisms appear to happen, things start to change.
It goes into the sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that passes the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, one might say that the <unk> of the body is going into evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I thought, well, <unk> <unk> death for <unk> seemed quite reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, every time I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas 90 years.
And one night someone hits your door of hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him you find a magnificent dancer, light dancer, a light light dance.
He looks at it and he says, <unk> for a <unk> of <unk>
He said, George, says, "I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different goal to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> only different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us healthy.
I wanted to get health to the disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is to pass the genome to the next <unk> <unk> and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view of an evolutionary point of view, you and I are kind of like magic rockets designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us go to the sea.
I think we all had the feeling that <unk> Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to get immortality through my work.
I want to show you <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily blame longevity.
They don't necessarily favors the biggest or the stronger or the faster or the faster and even the smarter.
Evolution favors the best adapted to its environment.
That's the only proof of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the bacteria <unk> that they can survive the heat of the <unk> that would be <unk> if there were fish there -- so it would have fish there, but they've managed to make that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's going on in evolution and if we come back to think about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look forward to the phase -- I would say there's lots of possibilities.
The first one is that I don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, we first have known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and cut from the population.
And secondly, as we have a species, we have <unk> our environment so that we are attached to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we have so much that it's no longer possible to have the isolation required for evolution.
A second possibility is that there's an evolution of the traditional traditional type, dictate by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is that the gears of evolution here will roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as the <unk> as a kind of <unk> planets are going to be the isolation and environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there is a third possibility, a possibility to be involved and intriguing and scary.
I call them <unk> the new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and selected for us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they are choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it is what it chooses to the individual and family level.
Think of them also that if it could be able to choose not only sex from your <unk> but in your body making genetic modifications to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or remove the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in their <unk>
If you look at the future that kind of changes is going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and sued 13 years.
<unk> billion dollars.
The next year to be finished, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the 3,000 billion base pairs in the human genome at the cost at 20,000 and in a week.
Not much of all, so that you actually make the human genome for <unk> and being more and more and more and more all the way of all.
These changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us themselves, but they're going to induce immunity against other viruses.
<unk> or there's no experimental experimental trial with the vaccine against flu flu -- cells from a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something good about the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine just another two little <unk>
They can change cells from their bodies but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the <unk> egg and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminating diabetes, eliminating <unk> reducing the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then, that same <unk> technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to also adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't we have the <unk> of a Ken <unk> especially if you could get it from the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why don't you have a <unk> muscle that allows us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions of pass this to the next generation, and we can adopt the attributes that we want to have become turned out to have become the evolution of before the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years, and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe occur within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these options to make a better society, more successful.
Or, we are going to choose to selectively make different attributes that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust, and more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest of all, we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and inherit the wisdom needed to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what we could do -- these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big bang when you're at 900 feet high.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a motor doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a single car seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the <unk>
So he immediately looked at it, and they said, "No problem: I probably <unk> some <unk>
The pilot had already <unk> the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the plane with the Hudson River.
Mostly that's not the way.
We went to the motors.
Imagine being on a plane and not <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three <unk> words you've heard about.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people that I wanted to come in, and I didn't, all the fences of the fences I wanted to repair all the experiences that I've wanted to have and never <unk>
While I thought about that further, I was a sentence, which is, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'll open.
I don't want to do anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, really has changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is as I <unk> the George Washington Bridge that I wasn't for a lot -- I thought I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my errors I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity, I also give place to my ego.
And I'm sorry the time that I would focus on things that didn't care about people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then as <unk> in that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm no longer trying to be <unk> to be <unk>
The third thing that I learned -- and this is like your mental watch, is <unk> 14 <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please get <unk>
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces as you look at those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, Whoa! I'll die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our lives.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just want one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing.
One month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --    And I scream, <unk> like a small kid.
And to me, that was the whole reason to be in the world.
At that point I understood that two points, which the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
He gave me a miracle, not to die that day.
And he gave me another gift, which was the possibility to look at the future and go back and live in another way.
You are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens to you on your plane -- and please don't be -- but you can imagine, and how do you fix it.
What is the thing that <unk> who are still expecting to do because they think they're going to live on <unk>
How do you change their relationships and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are the best parents to <unk>
Thank you.
I clearly have been blessed with a lot of projects that are <unk>
But the biggest thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came to his house after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
<unk> today has complete <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
Her work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation so that, obviously, graffiti is something that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
And so we decided that we were going to be <unk> to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with his brother and father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to communicate with him and that he is able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second, it's not that <unk> saw Stephen <unk> is not that all the people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be somebody who is important and you have a very good thing you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate <unk>
Did anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way, they're going to do with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I presented to me with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that signed a check that I had no idea how he was going to <unk>
I joined his brother and his father there at that very very moment, OK, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it's a ridiculous thing that someone who gets so much in your inside can't be <unk>
So I spoke at a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> Research Research, which has a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer and they draw on that and register the negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a cycle of life.
First they start with sexual organs, then with the bad words, after the attacks at Bush and in the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a cycle of life in their <unk>
And so the journey started.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of <unk> and very much move things on one side we had achieved a couple of things.
One is, you touch the gates of the insurance companies and get a machine so that you could find a machine for the Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's about the most <unk> I call <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "I don't know it. This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all over the world to get in every corner of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the garage board and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took the control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought that we were doing something completely stupid and that when they were <unk> would have taken off the walls of the walls and instead there would be <unk>
But for two weeks, we were going to go to the Carnegie tour, my son was part of my dog, and we created this.
It's called <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a pair of cheap sunlight that we bought in the <unk> <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
We take a camera <unk> <unk> we put it up on an LED light and now there's a device that is free -- and -- -- -- you know, we published the code -- we published the <unk> code, the software goes down to free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says <unk>
There is no hospital to say <unk>
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using just their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much to you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we come back to the emergency room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of programming, intense sessions from all night, Tony returned back to the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system, and it's looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed and I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot of the hospital.
And he came back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to take in the parking lot so we feel like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I was to take in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and somebody finally came to <unk> and I would get me out there so that I could get it out.
Isn't that wonderful?
It's kind of our love of war.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to improve it and make it faster and robust.
Since then, we've had all sorts of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us is making money with this.
All of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong took something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up from closing the <unk> is that in April of this year in the middle of the <unk> in downtown Los Angeles -- there's going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- all of them are going to be there.
It's going to be in the show that's pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: If you see something that isn't possible, do it possible.
None of what you have in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the microphone, -- nothing was possible at a certain time.
Do it go through anything in this room.
I'm not programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology, I just recognized something and I was excited about wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do every day when we find ourselves with something that we feel like to do. If it's not right now, when? And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I have spent the last few years ago in situations usually very difficult and at the same time as dangerous as dangerous time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a dangerous <unk> mine.
Film <unk> <unk> and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating it just fun at the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I've been <unk> in situations in horrible appearance, with the only goal to treat.
So when I knew that I would come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you may have heard of it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk>
I sent some text messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I volunteered on the name of the name of my head of 2011.
What was there was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that they have no idea what it is about and according to content it could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it on a ridiculous to you or your company doing it.
But I said that, it's a very good opportunity to do.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you would have asked me a year ago, I would never have heard of certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working, we examined the world of marketing, of advertising.
And as I said earlier, I've been in horrible situations over the last few years, but nothing could be done to me -- nothing could be <unk> for something so difficult to go into the rooms.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that I try to do a film -- and the marketing and advertising, and that the whole film is <unk> with <unk> of products, and <unk> and advertising.
The film is going to call "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that everything from top at the bottom, at the end of the end, it has <unk> and all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film is exploring this whole idea. <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is it <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk>
I'm a <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the X brand in the title but we're going to make sure we can <unk> all the categories that we could in the film.
Maybe you get a shoe -- and it becomes the most great shoe that you've got <unk>
The most great car that you've driven in "The largest film ever <unk> the best drink you have <unk> from "The largest <unk> of "The largest film ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then besides showing the brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> -- and we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the filmed film is transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this movie.
That's the whole whole idea, all the shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to help us make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> is going to be people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it's going to <unk> <unk> You don't <unk> David <unk> How much money takes to do this?
MS: A million and a half <unk> Very <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard the meeting with them, but it certainly will be worth convincing a couple of big markings on a couple of big markings on a couple of big markings on the <unk>
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that we go out of the film to look like a whole bunch of <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be <unk>
MS: But it's going to be difficult for the film to be I?
JK:
MS: ... means you're not very optimistic.
So <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We have to think about that brands.
MS: Yeah. So that's the <unk> And when you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where he go, <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: So I thought <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation outside of microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything about this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, it was to present the product to as many people as possible, to make so many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the separate media is not the idea to tell that new vehicle worth of attention that is going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, that my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this.
It was actually not such a mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> on Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that showed up.
I like your <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or easily detected or easily detected or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices being the last line perhaps the biggest line.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president of the <unk> even the <unk> the <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to make something changes suddenly changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives you --  -- like that weird bear is still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I began to talk to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story and say, "No, we want me to <unk> history.
We want it to give you a story, but we want to make sure story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would get me in some lie -- and there he is looking at me as a single <unk> saying, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
Is it your story, it's my story, and there's the story <unk>
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, an agency want to help me -- and that only because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> in many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to take off and go to business and go to business myself.
So what I started to see suddenly -- and I started giving me <unk> is that when you start to talk to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, huge, giant films and others that make films small, independent movies like mine.
And my friends who make movies of big, giant Hollywood say that the reason their movies have so much successful is due to the signs associated with the associated markings that they have.
And then my friends who do independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant films of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "Are you good for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you get to you."
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there was one of these <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man like to <unk> solid, to <unk> to <unk> as it is.
That's the look general.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at it.
Karen <unk> We're a small brand.
<unk> to the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> are more good a brand <unk>
So we don't have the budget that they have other brands.
So do things like this, you know, remind people is the reason why this interest is.
MS: What words would use to describe to <unk>
<unk> is white.
<unk> That's a big question.
Volunteer: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talked about something bold cool.
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you cool.
How do you keep you cool enough -- better than <unk> more than three times more cool.
Things like those who are <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a company <unk>
What about me? What about <unk>
I need to talk to you about the man on the street, to people like me, to <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good clothing.
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the <unk> brand.
<unk> Something unique. <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like the dark colors, a lot of gray colors and things like that.
And usually I wear a <unk> or I like the crystals and the way.
Woman: If Dan was a brand that could be a <unk> <unk> Mercedes <unk>
Man 2: I would call it <unk> <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: Some of the <unk> partly <unk> partly <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pet guy.
They use toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my small sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is just, because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: Nation <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a lawyer.
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we don't all be able to be done, but I often lie at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> of <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yes. The first picture is a family photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way of being.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? And I think your world is the world that <unk> like the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live in your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from and start in a place and in my case they come from and start in my family, West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk about.
MS: The next thing is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like the different things.
I like the weird things, I like the weird things.
A: Tell me about the <unk> for what does that do it?
What's the <unk> What phase of <unk> are you right now?
Why is it important to <unk> What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
<unk> more of you, who is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
It doesn't have fear. What kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> Thank you.)
A: thanks for your partner <unk> Great <unk> Yeah. Yeah.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to come out of this.
There was plenty of crazy about this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides of it, but I would focus on your <unk> the Morgan <unk> <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies just become <unk> in one of their strong points or the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to -- and it's nature to avoid the things that are not <unk> to avoid fear, those elements, and you actually become a positive day, and you make something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are you?
The first here is the classical Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS:
If someone asks you to take your identity or check your identity, your <unk> which would be?
You're a attribute of <unk> you are somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you more well a attribute of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful to be cool like <unk> contemporary -- <unk> bold or bold such as <unk> <unk> quickly or <unk> <unk> <unk> magical or mystical <unk>
Or are you rather than attribute <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
You're established, you're traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're reliable, stable, familiar, safe, sacred, <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film, we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because you wouldn't have control, you wouldn't have control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this film of how they now use MRI to identify the centers of the desire in the brain both for commercial marketing as a film.
We went to San Francisco, where you have banned advertising in the air.
In the entire city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are getting into the way in schools with problems of money in the U.S.
The incredible thing for me is that projects in which I've had the greatest answer or that I've been more successful in the ones that I've been interacting with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They went to the <unk> they took off their <unk> and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to treat directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to do to think about people, that's going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how do you gone? they <unk>
Well, since the movie was early at the <unk> <unk> Let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was early in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions on the media for this film.
This is just a <unk> period.
That's just in <unk> or press and TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to win momentum.
And it's not bad for all the agencies that we talked about is giving their customers to be a part.
I've always believed that if you take a risks, if you take risks, that in those risks there is opportunities.
I think when you pull out the people that are pushing them into failure.
I think when you train their employees into loss aversion is preparing their entire company to reward them of rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to advance is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We have to encourage people to have no fear of opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, we're going to move forward, I think we need to give it to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
It was afraid of fear. It was the risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
Now more than ever honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, my whole talk, <unk> has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So, <unk> in the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED matrix, the <unk> Foundation -- a check for <unk> to be applied to my TED <unk>
The idea behind the IT worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the plant of <unk> <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are systems control systems in real time.
If we can compromise these systems that are controlled speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with a centrifuge.
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software are from a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put an effective virus from Windows in a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray, and then we're smart.
This is the plan behind <unk>
So we started with an <unk>
The <unk> comes to the gray, <unk> damages the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discover this.
When we started investigating <unk> about six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing you knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of <unk> the <unk> used multiple vulnerabilities <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these systems.
That was called attention, and we started an experiment where we infect our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
So they got very strange.
<unk> <unk> as a lab rat who didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
It had no sense for me.
And then I had to experience different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking for actively looking at the gray box if you find a specific settings and even if the program that is trying to infect it's actually working on that <unk>
If it doesn't, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, let's say a power plant plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
So better than the goal soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two <unk> bombs and a big one.
We also saw that they were very professionally armed with people who obviously had all the internal information.
They would get all the points to attack.
You probably even know how much it gets to the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell you the burden it's very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code code.
We're talking about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like the old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find sense of this code.
What we were looking at at the beginning were calls in the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking for <unk> and data structures and tried to deal with it with the real world, with potential goals of the real world.
We need <unk> theories that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a black <unk> and it's certainly located in Iran, because that's where most of the infections has been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the plant of nuclear power plant and the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and energy plants between our <unk>
I called them and I asked them in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with control of the <unk>
<unk> is that cell part inside the <unk> that black object that you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can be <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the heart goal was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort for <unk> to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to figure out the big digital <unk> looking at the data and its structures.
So, for example, the number <unk> shows up in that code, you can't afford it.
I started looking at scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they are <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every <unk> contains <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what did we find in the code code.
A kind of structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in our hands.
And so that I didn't have <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been involved after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> in dead ends.
And yet, we found that both digital <unk> would happen to one single and very goal, but from different <unk>
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and doing <unk> <unk> and <unk> and big <unk> it communicates with six <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> we are very confident that we've determined what is the <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We don't have to worry about other goals for <unk>
Here I show you some very interesting things that we just looked at me.
There is the gray, <unk> and up there you see the <unk>
What this thing does is to intercept the values values for example, of the pressure sensors and the infrared sensors and provides <unk> code, which is still running during attack, with false <unk>
And believe it or not, this false entry data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds on video <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the fourth control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a power plant, when the big steam turbine goes down, you have to open escape valves on a <unk>
Obviously, this can't make a human operator.
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And not the <unk> and the security system is <unk>
That scares it.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically with <unk> with <unk>
It could also work too, for example, in a power plant, or a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> to disseminate this burden with a <unk> key, as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional <unk> technology for <unk>
They make it as much as possible.
And if you look at that, with what <unk> is a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large number of goals.
We need to face the implications, and better than we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been done in a lot of sides that people assumes that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What is your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, you really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the superpower superpower one.
There is a story, and that's the United States, luckily, <unk>
Because, in a way, our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
So I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and give them <unk> or the other one that makes users of lawn chairs come up and start walking.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different than something that gets in the morning, gives you a great force, which is also increasing your speed, and help, for example, to drive the balance.
It's actually the true integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect it with the universe and with other amazing beings.
This is not an idea.
To show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, you should take on your back, a <unk> charge of 45 pounds, and it's going to be able to get even more team.
Obviously this leads to some major complications -- injuries on the back, in 30 percent of soldiers -- with chronic damage from back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Human Human Human Human commons.
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can give you 90 pounds per block for many hours.
Their flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and run a big <unk>
So what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it enhances my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back to the look at the users of the wheelchair, which I feel particularly <unk>
There are <unk> million people in the wheels, around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative calculation here.
We talk about something that happens with often, very young people, with damage into the spinal cord than when they start their life -- to the 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We also talk about the population of the aging population that will be added quickly.
Their only option, many times -- by a brain injury or some other complication -- is the <unk>
And this has been this for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who, 19 years ago had an injury in the neocortical column, and as a result couldn't walk back for 19, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors.
It was completely not <unk> in crutches that send signals to board, here on the back.
There are some batteries that give you energy to the motors on the <unk> and on the knees, and they make them advance with this very soft and very natural.
AB: I was 24 years at the top of my life, when, by a stranger jump in the air, skiing it down it was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all sensation and all the <unk> movement.
Shortly after that, a doctor walked into my room at the hospital, and he said, <unk> will never come back to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So he stole me to the last hint of hope of my being.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs on <unk> climbing rocks and even ride on a bicycle <unk>
But they've never invented anything to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just soldiers, but to Amanda, and all the users of the chairs of the wheels, all of them.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say, hi, and play is the order of the day -- where the fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival. Man festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know all of your cousins.
This is the world of wild Bonobos of the rainforests of Congo.
The Bonobos are, along with the chimpanzees, their living relatives more <unk>
That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, the chimps are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've been able to have a lot too seriously, in our narratives of human evolution.
But the Bonobos are telling us the other side of the currency.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by large, <unk> the society Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a society very tolerant where lethal violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the Bonobos are the least <unk> of great apes.
They live in the depths of the forest <unk> and it's been very hard to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the global <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that has been sustained for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction will also put in danger of the Bonobo.
The hunting meat trade and deforestation is making you physically fill in a stadium with the Bonobos that are in the world -- and honestly we're not safe from it.
However, on this land of violence and chaos can be heard hidden by the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them like the apes <unk> love, not <unk> because they have a frequent <unk> <unk> and <unk> to manage conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> as humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a kids' game.
For us, and for them to the game is fundamental to establish links and encouraging <unk>
With him we learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors of connections.
And when you see the game Bonobo sees the roots of the <unk> the dance and the human discovery.
The game is the glue that brings us together.
I don't know how you play it, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> game, and I don't talk about soccer.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk> <unk>
I just believe that in this case he loves him, right?
Yeah.
So sexual play is common so much in Bonobos as in humans.
And this video really is interesting because it <unk> this video really is interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into the game -- like the <unk> and also how play requires trust, and <unk> <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> you can adopt many ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is a young woman, who is playing with a <unk> water.
I think that like her, sometimes we played themselves, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of the understanding that Bonobos are given us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world with greater creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk>
To adapt success to a world that changes we have to play.
But <unk> the most our ability to game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For Bonobos and humans alike, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems the less appropriate to play, you can be the moments where it is the most <unk>
And so fellow primates, let's accept this gift of evolution and play together as we <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York -- I am responsible for development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I am not battling poverty, they were fires as a captain of Captain <unk> volunteers.
And in our city, where volunteers are assigned to a highly skilled staff -- you have to get to the fire site very soon to enter action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so he had a pretty high probability of going.
But yet there was a career standing against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found the <unk> he was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at night, she was standing on night, and she was standing outside in the rain, under <unk> and <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got before I am, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> first to the captain and he asked her to go up and save the dog house.
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There I was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that during the rest of his life, he would have to tell the people who walked into a burning building to save a live one, because I made it for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to get between the house.
I need you to <unk> <unk> the fire, and bring this woman a couple of <unk>
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> on the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the fire firemen -- that at the top or less or less had gone off the fire and walked into the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my burden back on the ladder where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog at the front door.
<unk> from the house treasures for the owner of home where, as he would expect, his trove got much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the owner of <unk> house for the brave effort he demonstrated to save his house.
The kindness that she looked at about the other was that someone had reached even a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> like my calling for a voluntary firefighter is witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of acts of grace and courage in the individual level.
And you know what have I learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have made or do -- or they are by <unk> remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you this: Not wait.
Don't wait to win the first million to make difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, you go right now.
<unk> food in a dining room, a <unk> park.
Be mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save the life of somebody but every day we're going to influence somebody's life.
So I trained the <unk> <unk> shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem odd, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks they built in <unk> with a very simple idea, modules of a fixed measure that fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things that we, as buildings or bridges, a brick at a time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> came up with this.
He was called <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to every home.
It's been estimated that they've made over 400 billion or 75 bricks in the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, the same year in the labs, Bell, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of aesthetic structures, piled up about other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block the transistor allows you to make much bigger circuits and more complex circuits a brick at a time.
But there's a <unk> difference. The transistor was just for experts.
I personally didn't think about it, that the building blocks of our time are being reserved for the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of taking the power of engineers from artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics every one with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they come together through magnets.
So they can't be placed in the wrong way.
The bricks have a gene code.
The green is the <unk> the blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange of color is the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue with a green and very quickly, you can start to make bigger circuits.
A blue with one green is producing light.
Can we put a button in the middle, and we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse module that is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
We put this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are really very powerful.
Instead of having to <unk> connecting and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using a very simple <unk>
To make <unk> faster or slower, just turn this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing collection.
We want all the interactions in the world to fire them ready to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We've given kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an amazing experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how a light works, or why the door of an elevator is held open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So, for example, designers without any electronic experience start playing with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> --  -- a few weeks ago, we took the designers from the Rhode Island School of Rhode Island, which has no experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper and we said, "Let's take something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, an <unk> canyon in motion.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is very afraid of the dark.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became a different material.
And we want this material to reach all of us.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the files of design and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world in which we live, this interactive world is ours.
So let me go.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is looking for to engage with the environment to focus on.
It's distributed collaboration.
This is a small video of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
It can take a little bit in <unk>
We can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I'm going to term the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that's supposed to do, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like a <unk> of Peace <unk>
They had a few members every year, and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to the Third World -- we send them to the wild world.
They made big <unk> worked with the employees.
Their task is to show the chances of today's technology.
Meet <unk>
It's a parking tickets.
Here it appears as if I could look at a date, but what it really looks for is someone got to clean it when he gets caught through the snow because he knows it's not very good by turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did he ask for help of this way so <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment, I had a lot last year.
They realized the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something more <unk> than the citizens <unk> with shovels sidewalks right in front of them.
So it did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You support <unk> when you <unk>
So when you do that, you put a name, in this case, he put him <unk>
If you don't do it, somebody can <unk>
I mean, it has a players' component of it.
It's a modest app.
Maybe it's the smallest of 21 apps last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it spreads into viral form.
A group of systems in the city of <unk> when you see this app realized that I could use it, not for snow, but for citizens to embrace <unk>
It's very important to work in the tsunami of tsunami, but people are <unk>
So it asks the citizens that the <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago has just been <unk> to get people to clean sidewalks up when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that we can use it.
And this has been spread out of <unk> <unk>
If you know a little bit of government technology will know that this doesn't normally happen.
<unk> acquisition generally takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool that parents could choose the best school for their children.
And then they told us that I had done the normal channels would have taken at least two and a half million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there's a project in the power of California from California that until the moment has gone over 2,000 million dollars and doesn't work.
And there are projects like this on every level of government.
So an app that shows up in a couple of days, and it spreads into viral form is a kind of shot from warning to the institution of the government.
It suggests to the world's best ways to work, not like in private companies, as many people think it should be.
Nor is a technological company, but more like the Internet itself.
That is, without constraints, in the open and <unk> way.
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to tackle the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution, but as a problem of collective action.
And that's really good because it turns out that we're very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very big community of people who are building the tools so that they are building together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country who contribute to <unk> applications every day in their own communities.
They haven't been given to the government.
Do you feel a lot of frustration in front of it, but they don't get to <unk>
And these people know something we've lost in sight.
And it is that if we leave the feelings of the politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that make us nuts, the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What are we doing together because alone not <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
The policy is not <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately <unk> of us -- remember that by <unk> the <unk> The way it thought is affecting the way that change change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, especially about <unk>
This is the center of health care and information.
It is the place that serves the calls if you make that in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this phone call.
<unk> <unk> at the base of official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open up the doors of the house, put it very hard music and see if it was <unk>
And it worked. So well for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a telephone center.
It's got a application, and mobile phone called <unk> <unk>
You don't get that application.
It was the work of very smart people from the Bureau of New <unk>
So one day, this actually gets this <unk> <unk> in my garbage garbage -- I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do to <unk>
The <unk> dynamics is different.
Scott was speaking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so you can all see this.
In this case, he saw it a neighbor.
The next report said, "I'd come up to place, I found the cube of garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went home. I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical.
And it's also a great example of the government income to the distributed volunteer collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of the platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to become <unk> and help others.
So, an citizen helped another but here the government had a key player.
It connected the two people.
And it could have been connected to the government services, but the neighbor is a better and more cheap alternative than the government services.
When one neighbor helps another neighbor <unk> communities.
If we call control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people understand it, but think you're the input from the other.
That our input to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a <unk> leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government will <unk> our values and we need our needs, and then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface layer of the <unk>
At the bottom is what we call <unk>
And we say that word <unk>
But it's that <unk> what keeps it from that that belongs to us that we funded as something that operates on our <unk> that one thing, and we are losing power.
People believe that politics is <unk>
If we want this institution to work, we'll have to make the bureaucracy be <unk>
Because that's where the real government of government.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That does the <unk> movement.
They've been <unk>
It's a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed report of <unk> pages in response to the request of the financial reform project.
That is not political activism -- it's <unk>
And for the ones that we have <unk> to the government, is time for us to ask ourselves, what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really believe that we have to go without fixing the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't leave the government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root function of government so that it can expand to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not that hard to act <unk> only to articulate systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I, to <unk> I'm an older generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face on who's going to <unk> they're all going to talk about.
They can express their opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when the government problem is to deal with a lot of them to do to hear their voices.
They're using your hands.
They get the work to work in order to program applications that make the government better.
And those applications allow us to use their hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> by taking out -- dumping a cube of garbage that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we were able to have <unk> those <unk> and a lot of people do.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get the <unk>
So I want to ask everyone here, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, we will be a crowd of voices, or we will also be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, jails and death row.
I've spent most of my life in communities that are involved in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED watching and hearing these stimulus has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I noticed in this short time is that TED has an identity.
And the things that are saying here are impact around the world.
In occasions, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have a different way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we have seen fantastic.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you teach them with feeling, you can have a special meaning of it.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the rule of law, my job.
I learned this from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a family <unk> dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was tough it was strong, had power.
It was the last word in the family in the family.
She <unk> many of them in our home.
He was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
Their parents were born in slavery in Virginia over the <unk>
She was born over the <unk> and his experience with slavery -- the way I saw the world.
She was <unk> but she was also <unk>
When I was a little bit, and I looked at it, she was approaching me and I was a good hug.
I became so hard that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I was coming back to me, and he said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I told him that no, I was going back again and if I said I was saying yes, I made me in peace.
I had this human quality that would always want to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the smallest of 10.
In occasions, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture his time and her attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and I looked at me.
At first, I thought it was a game.
So he looked at her and smile, but she was very serious.
After 15 to 20 minutes, she stood up, I went through the room, I took my hand and said, "Come on. We are both going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me outside, and he said, "I will tell you something, but you can't tell <unk>
I said, "It's okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I didn't know it, I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And you say, "I think you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do it."
I'll never forget it.
Then he said to me, "I wish I want you to get three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to do is you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, I said, "Yes, I will do that."
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to do is you are always going to do the right thing, even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yeah, I'll do that."
Then he finally said, "The third thing I want you to do is that I never get <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yeah, I'll do that."
I grew up in the field, in South Africa, I have a brother a year older and a sister a younger year.
When I was 14 to 15, a day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> grabbed my sister and me and I went for the forest.
We just got to do the <unk> of the line.
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You know, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> And you always do the same thing as we are.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
I was looking at the <unk> and he said, "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this will spread <unk>
But I have 52 years, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this to be a <unk> I mean by the power that the identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that they really don't make sense of it.
We can't get them to do things that don't think we can do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died of age-related diseases with alcohol.
And these were the things that it was, by it, we had to <unk>
Now, I'll try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different than it was about 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In the United States, we have the largest incarceration rate of the world.
We have seven million people in probation.
And this mass incarceration in my view, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities -- there are so much <unk> so much despair, so much despair, determined by these facts.
One in three black is between the 18 and the 30 years is in jail or a parole.
In urban <unk> around the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore Baltimore Washington, 50 to 60 percent of all the young color of color are in jail or freedom in probation.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a court system that makes you much better if you're rich and guilty.
It's not <unk> but wealth is <unk>
And it seems like we feel very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger make us believe that these are not problems we are.
We are <unk>
I find it interesting.
We're looking at our work some remarkable developments in our work.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, I love you with rights as long as you have criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male population has lost the right to vote.
And if we show it to the next 10 years the level of loss of rights will be as high as it was before the law of the entitled to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent kids.
Many of my clients are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where it was sentence to 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country prison for children, without a chance to come out.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people in death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a sense of sense, you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die for the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by the crimes of <unk> but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
death penalty in America is defined by error.
In every nine people who have been identified with one that's innocent who is <unk> and liberated from death row.
One rate of error, was an innocent in nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would not be allowed to fly fly airplanes if every nine than <unk> you would have been <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students on history of history -- I talk about slavery.
I talk about terrorism, the time that began at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted until the Second World War.
We don't really know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was kind of defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what he defined his lives.
Now there are older people who come to me and tell me, <unk> Stevenson, you teaches talks, and makes people who stop saying that in our history, we deal with the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say that we grew up with that."
The era of terrorism went on obviously, with <unk> and decades of <unk> and <unk> and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time we get to each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that you couldn't overcome <unk> <unk> without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide they had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood up after my presentation and said, "You know that it's well disturbing to listen to what I <unk>
<unk> "We don't have death penalty in Germany.
We will never be able to get it here."
The room was quiet and a lady said, "There is no way that we can ever get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> and <unk> we put us to <unk>
Let's get it on this.
How do we <unk> in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in their most <unk>
We could not make it <unk>
Would it be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnect.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you really don't care about these tough issues, the positive things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology, <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But then, those realities are driven by suffering, the abuse, <unk> <unk>
In my opinion, we need to integrate both of these things.
We talk about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more dedication with the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means that you want to spend more time thinking and talking about the poor, the ones that will never come to TED.
Think about them it is, in a way, something that's inside our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen before.
So we are. Even though it's so rational, as <unk> as <unk>
With innovation, with creativity. <unk> is not just the brain ideas.
These things come from ideas that are also going from the heart.
This connection to the heart of the heart is what drives us to look at it not just as bright and <unk> but also in the dark and the difficult.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in the East Europe suffering the <unk> we looked at all sorts of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a willingness to be in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think, even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There is no related <unk> to technology and design, that allows us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to argue that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we are ignoring these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer -- to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were used to just speak.
Occasionally, I call it to me, to say to me, <unk> comes the lady <unk> we're going to get together to speak.
Do you want to come and look at it.
I said, "I know lady. Be <unk>
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read him <unk>
So I was going to go and just the <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And at one occasion, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks went to me and said, "Now, let me give me this idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give him my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
And we try to help those who have been convicted <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in criminal justice.
We try to end up with the sentences for life, without liberty for children.
We try to do something about a death penalty line.
We try to reduce the population in jail.
We try to end up with the <unk> <unk>
I gave all my best speech and he looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At that point, Ms. <unk> <unk> put my finger on the face and said, "It's why you have to be very <unk>
I think that actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find a way to tackle those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and to believe that every one of us is higher to the worst that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't blame you, it's not that it's a <unk>
Even if someone kills the other, it's not that it's a murderer.
This is why I think there's a basic dignity in the people who should be <unk> by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's right.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> we don't judge our technology, because of our designs, not for our intellectual ability or rational.
At the end, the character of a society, not because of the way they treat the rich and powerful societies, but because of how the poor, they treat the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound themes about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I make too much force.
<unk> tired, like all.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in an important way.
I've been representing these kids who have been convicted of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients about 13 and 14 years old, which has been <unk> so that they were <unk> as adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can an judge turn to someone in what isn't it?
Justice <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
One night too late I was awake at the wake of my God, if the judge can turn you into something that you don't say you don't say you don't say you should have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was too late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a client from 14 years old, poor, poor, white.
I started working on <unk> with a <unk> saying, <unk> for my <unk> black client to be treated like a <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk>
In <unk> I put that there had been behavioral conduct in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and the process.
There was a <unk> line on how this country is no ethical but a whole lack of ethics.
I woke up the next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had been <unk> but she had sent it to court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh God, I have to go to the court for this case, stupid.
I got into the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I was in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally went down from the car to <unk> to court.
I was going up the stairs when I met a black man <unk> was the <unk> of court.
When he saw me, she came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
And I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "Are you <unk> I said yes.
And so I got bored and <unk>
And I heard me in the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
And that connected to my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a sense of hope.
Well, I went into the audiences.
When I walked in, the judge saw me.
And he said, <unk> Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk> me." And we started walking.
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They got the policemen the prosecutors and the <unk>
Suddenly, not knowing how, the room was full of people, and we're all screaming because we talked about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the eye of the eye I got to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I would look through the window and listen to all that <unk>
I was walking over here and for there.
Finally, this old black black, with an concern, I walked into the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, Justice <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> he showed up <unk> because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant <unk> on the old black <unk>
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> hall.
And the old man stood up, he looked at the <unk> he looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> this <unk> to tell this young man to keep his view on the goal with <unk>
I've come to TED today, because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds towards justice.
We can't truly be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and by dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity have to get to the <unk> of <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of you who share this, I just want to tell you to keep the view on the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Wait for you to hear and see an obvious desire to the audience, from this community, to help in your minds, to do something.
Something that is not a <unk> What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which you will make a effort to get the funds that are now spending today in law policies today.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death row in the next five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of cases of homicide in <unk>
<unk> of rapes don't get at all.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these funds to make the law, to safety.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it's said that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to those who believe it is?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not by crimes in violence.
It's because of the 21st War war.
That's why this increases in the population of <unk>
And we let us convince you for the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people out to the <unk> chain to steal a bicycle, by stealing a bicycle, for small crimes against the property, rather than making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy is about punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> Have you really excited -- you are here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months, <unk> could be in the last six days or in the last six years.
The idea is that press media prefer negative news to negative news, because our minds pay attention to you.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day, our senses are getting a lot more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing really matters to survive, the first stop of all of this data is an old fragment of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our warning detector, the <unk>
<unk> and record all of the information for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So from a <unk> of stories that are going to look at the negative ones.
That old saying of the <unk> "If there are blood, <unk> is very true.
And given that all digital devices give us bad news, the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, no wonder we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going to be wrong on worse.
But maybe it isn't.
Maybe instead, what really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps the huge progress done in the last century for a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good issues -- climate change, the extinction of species, the shortage of water and <unk> no doubt we have.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and the long run, we just had them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> the average average income per capita adjusted to inflation has been <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that the world's literacy country about 25 percent over 80 to over 80 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people are <unk>
And we continue to make more high and higher education.
In fact, we redefined meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the U.S., a lot of the people who live under the poverty have electricity, water water, <unk> television, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> de <unk> <unk> <unk> on the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
And so much of this is a lot of technology and lately, its exponential growth.
My good Kurzweil and Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that I had on information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the performance performance in about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad times, in war and peace, in depression and <unk>
It is the building computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop at any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law on the left, it's going up.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends from <unk> call computing infinite and sensors and networks, the 3D printing and its ability to democratize and distribute personalized production on all of the planet -- synthetic biology, the fuels and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> the <unk> the
I mean, how many saw the victory on "Jeopardy" of Watson, from <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked for the newspapers the best headline than <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> to <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
<unk> with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everyone on your phone.
Four years ago, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new college called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And each year, we asked them to release a company, or a service or service that can positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can actually impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, I would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating plenty, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each <unk> in the planet, it's about creating a life of how possible.
It's about taking that it's scarce and make it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of <unk> Three of the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
They went to dinner the king of <unk>
<unk> troops ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with <unk>
But the <unk> king ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal of the planet, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
For that reason, the tip of the Washington to Washington is aluminum
You see, even though aluminum is the Earth's mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as a pure metal as well.
It's tied up by oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made a aluminum thing that we use it as if it was <unk>
So let's take this analogy towards the future.
Let's think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet that are going to be five times more energy than we used in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about scarcity, but about <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the <unk> per capita <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy took 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that by the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to the age of 15 national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about wars in the water.
Remember when Carl Sagan has pointed the Voyager down to the Earth, in 1990, after country <unk>
Let's get a famous picture. How do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, <unk> is saltwater, water, two percent of it is ice, and we fought for the water <unk> on the planet, but there is a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I would like to share with you, I was allowed to share your technology called <unk> <unk>
It is able to generate a thousand gallons of drinking water from any given source, saltwater, water, a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coke just thought that it will make a major test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence that will be, Coca-Cola is put in the world in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an extraordinary innovation by this technology that you have.
And we've seen it in cell phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration penetration in the developing world by the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan is 25 years ago.
And if you have a smart smartphone with Google, has access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton does 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications and communications that nobody could have predicted before.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid for tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video <unk> video, images, libraries of books and music, technology technology, now <unk> and lose value value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best part of it is going to come when the health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is called the X X <unk> <unk>
We are challenging to the teams of the world so that we can bring these technologies into a mobile device that you speak, and because it has <unk> you can be extracted from your finger -- you can be extracted from your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnostics that a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the world in the developing world where there is no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this <unk> device has a RNA virus or DNA that I don't want to call the health and to call the health and first of all, prevent the pandemic.
But this is the greatest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it a billion <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just had the brand of seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against the demographic explosion is to give the world of education and health care.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people in 2010, connected to connected.
By 2020, we'll go from two billion to five billion of the Internet users.
Three billion minds have never been <unk> that you add to the global conversation.
What will these people?
What do you say? What wishes to <unk>
And instead of an economic collapse, we will have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> from more health through the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of 3D impressions and computation in the cloud of the cloud are more productive than ever before.
What can you give us three billion more members of humanity, healthy educated and <unk>
How about some voices never before <unk>
What if we give them to the oppressed. everywhere they are, a voice to be <unk> and being able to do the first time?
What about these 3,000 billion.
And if they are contributions we can't <unk>
So one thing that I learned with the X Prize, is that teams guided by their passion with an objective of course, can do things that were <unk> things that could only do the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to finish up with a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and functionality.
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this university teachers, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people came together and started <unk>
And it's been shown that today the machinery of human patterns of human patterns is better by folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, which gives me a huge amount of trust in the future is that we have more power to take people to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the innovative <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that are given to us to work on the solution of the big challenges and do what we should do.
We have for a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very scary idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I will give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like this.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it a lot up to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Cross <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special.
But the case is we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures still say that they are still <unk>
So what about here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept: <unk>
Because I was there in <unk> studying <unk> in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I was really burned with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition in the sun.
<unk> was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from a few <unk>
There were <unk> about 20 centimeter -- the black date.
And the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so it was made over the middle in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the number of fish had gone down in half.
I went to the five inches.
We would have a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s, which was started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
<unk> development was meant to impose the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> the industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty good, he called the <unk> four.
I went out to fish on it, and we did studies in southern China <unk> and especially in the Beaufort Sea.
What we captured there was something <unk>
<unk> now -- the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are on the background.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny <unk> about <unk> remains that they're coral reef fish.
In short, the sea floor came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you make a study and then it starts commercial fishing.
The background happens to be a solid coral background in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not the <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to get it out, because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen are picking up every time you go to a area where they have never fish.
But it's no <unk>
<unk> the world, but we don't remember it.
So let's take the starting point to start at the new level, not remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the axis, we have things -- biodiversity, and many of the <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation uses the images I received to the beginning of their conscious life, as normal as normal and the extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can look at the question of changes.
And at the end to keep a few <unk> remains.
And that, in great extent, is we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that they don't are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when ethnic societies kill animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very prevalent before <unk> it's a little uncommon.
You don't lose animals.
You lose underground animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a sea synonymous with big fish.
They become unusual because the <unk>
You have a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a way before they would expect it to have the evidence.
So for example, the anecdote that some of us are related to you as a captain of such a little bit of fish in this area cannot be used or generally they don't use it as the scientists of the fish, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
From there the huge role that it can make up a protected area.
Because with the marine protected areas, we really <unk> the past.
<unk> the past that people can't believe because the starting point has been run and is extremely low.
That's for the people that you can see a marine protected area and they can benefit from the vision that you can -- which allows them to erase their point of <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the people in the Midwest, for example?
I think there is the arts and film maybe you can fill the vacuum.
This is a simulation of the Bay of <unk>
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the Bay bay 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think why people were moved with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why do they <unk> with the <unk>
Because it raises something that in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to giving, is to suggest to you to make <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> manager and I look at YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So we're going to see why the videos are <unk> and what does it have to do with that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed to be very, very difficult.
But today's video today makes any of us, or our actions, copper <unk> in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be done famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They climb over 48 hours on YouTube for a minute.
And of these, just a small percentage of you can get viral to receive lots of visits -- and it makes <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of participation and a surprise.
Okay, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this filmed video outside of his house in National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the views in the popularity of last summer.
<unk> was not saying to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
He was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this injection.
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> are given new things and interesting and <unk> to a wider audience.
RS:
<unk> from Rebecca Black is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have come out of nowhere.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they are also Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science Science was one of the first people to make a joke about the video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that one person or a group of creators take a point of view and share it with a more broad audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who share this great inner joke then starts talking about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
So unlike the 21st-century entertainment unlike the 20th century, this community engagement is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an engineered animation with a music <unk>
That's it. That's it.
This year, you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know there's a version of three hours that has seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats that you saw other cats see the video.
But the important thing here is creativity that awoke between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody did an ancient version.
And then it became international did.
Suddenly, it came up a whole community of <unk> which made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we can all form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or RS: Black or <unk> <unk>
What can the script have been written by this situation?
In a world where two days you go up two days of video per minute, just the only one and unexpected can <unk> the way these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a kind that protest against the <unk> in New York, I admit I didn't interested in too much.
Casey <unk> I was overwhelmed by not circular for <unk> but often there are obstacles that prevent you properly through the <unk>
KA: Thank you to the surprise of the surprise and his humor, Casey <unk> I managed to take five million watched and understand his idea.
So this approach is worth the new thing that we do differently.
And all of this leads us to a big <unk>
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of trend, creative communities of participation, fully unexpected, are features of a new type of media -- of a new culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines the popular.
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin started on YouTube.
You can't get permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a little owners from our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- it's just the current media features -- but we have <unk> entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that is still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a lifetime.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life was supported by the only unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> facing the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
And the words, for so long friends, now <unk>
It was happening in silence.
He died broken by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to be <unk> but it was <unk>
And the next part of the puzzle is about a boat to dawn <unk> upward to the sea.
My mother, <unk> was just 18 when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been destined to a <unk> task for her family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> of four years that challenges the fiction, a boat goes down to the sea <unk> <unk>
Every adults knew the risks.
The highest fear was the <unk> the rape and death.
As most of the adults, my mother was wearing a <unk> with poison.
If we were born, we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the motor, the <unk> diving into each wave, and the horizon vast and void.
I don't remember hackers who came up with several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start by six hours.
But I remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and she died, finishing up the journey was too much for it; and the first apple that I tried -- given for the men on the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations, shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of <unk> class, whose population is <unk>
Unlike the middle class suburbs whose existence was <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that were coming from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English English was traded between people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a car assembly line, working six days -- double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in IT <unk> of <unk>
We were poor.
Every single person were <unk> and established an extra <unk> in English and math, wouldn't mind what was supposed to be <unk> which was usually <unk>
Two pairs of middle to school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform until the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were rare and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> again.
At home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I would go on the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were <unk> on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother had <unk> all the boat.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares were going to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, and then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And women would come with their stories about men who couldn't do the mad and <unk> and <unk> kids that were stuck between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they were created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic <unk> student, relentless for what I <unk> from myself.
On the other, it was <unk> in the other, <unk> tragically <unk> by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many of them got aid through the years.
And because of that work, when I was studying my last year of man, I was elected the Australian <unk> of the year.
And I was <unk> out of a piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges of it didn't happen.
So <unk> resident resident of <unk> was now so <unk> refugee and a social activist and a social activist invited me to speak in sites that had never heard of, and in houses whose existence had never imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat to the <unk> and the comfort of life in a suburb <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two girls ending up the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each one and he was going to <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had the same age that she had when she got into the ship.
He had never been an option.
<unk> told me, "What are you not <unk>
So I talked about <unk> juvenile and education and <unk> the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more I talked to the more I was talking about it was <unk> to speak.
I met people from all the roads in life, many of them doing what we <unk> living on the border of the possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk>
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a unknown, a newly <unk> one, and not only that it's good, but it's something that I will be grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> it can easily mean accepting the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave up enough steps outside of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was a energy there, a optimism <unk> a rare mix of humility and <unk>
So I followed my intuition.
He took a small group of people who the slogan can't <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of each day, I was making a giant pot of soup that all <unk>
They go up to good entry at night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some bright ones, and we opened up.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
After one journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later there was <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before I end up, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
Her father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up.
On 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of their husband, he caused an <unk> to the <unk> and to bring the cause it was, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
He can't do it <unk>
I was in the shower in the fourth of a hotel in <unk> when she died, 1,000 miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and saw her standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called a few minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell stories, and we made sure that we were still with it.
At night, a monk came and said he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why do her hand is warm and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You haven't been <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
And because we were and how life built us now we can see that the men that have come to our lives would have become <unk>
The defeat would have easily <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could wish that for it?
However, I'm afraid of the privilege of the easy right.
I can give you a <unk> in their lives, becoming brave in each wave, the <unk> rate of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give them and see them in a certain way, I would do.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of <unk> here in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the sky <unk> with the singer <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation with how nothing has changed since the time of the old Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time, when I was <unk> the great warrior warrior Indian, I had <unk> he would take a bow and a <unk> on the ground, got water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that makes me very much.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I had this idea of losing the ability to enjoy the ability to enjoy and appreciating a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't afford it to my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow magic, I don't kill her.
As a child my grandfather gave me a <unk> of pocket.
And this <unk> piece of 50 years was to my most magic.
It became a golden door to a world filled with images, of hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phone, the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent them from <unk>
Do our inspiration.
And so I was <unk> I came up with this technological world to see how we use it to create magic, rather than kill her.
<unk> books since 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a <unk> device able to connect the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we took the book.
Where do we are.
They bring the text with the picture, animation and touch.
<unk> becomes more and more <unk>
But what does it do for that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And so,   He says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
In several moments, I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- that comes led to me.
My inner girl is excited with all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of magic.
And I don't mean magicians and <unk> but to that magic of childhood, those ideas that are <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always turned out to me.
So over here, we have to shift the iPad to release firefly fireflies.
And they actually light up your way in what comes from the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated with a little girl was that a whole galaxy.
So here, every book and every world is transformed into a <unk> that I would go into this magical device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In all of the fantasy I have always been maps of it, but they've been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you over the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another tremendously important aspect for me is to create Indian content.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of fairies and <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras on Indra over the millennia, in an old <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back in a <unk> child story.
In a story that deals with current issues as environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the past 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they have not left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our kids into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go outside, take the camera or the iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a girl I had lots of <unk> stones, stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason, kids don't do it.
So to recover this childhood ritual you have to go out and, in a chapter, we would take a picture to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So this creates a digital collection of pictures that then you can put on the Web.
A picture of London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Within the variations of connection between magic, Earth and technology is many possibilities.
In the next book we asked to have an interaction where you go out with the iPad, and the video on and it turns out and through augmented reality you see a bunch of cartoons that appear on the inner plants.
And at a moment the screen is full of leaves in the screen.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> so you can read the rest of the book.
We are going to a world where the forces of nature are linked with technology and magic and technology come to each other.
We have the power of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that we sat through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why a lot of projects from <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stopped listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a CEO,
And not a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk> What do you do?"
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems that all of all, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail, because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi domain. It's a very simple thing.
It's got a turn, <unk> and <unk>
Every morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to a 95 percent <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor in <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is not at the same time when you need <unk> or some urgency like that, but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
As some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before you go up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a <unk>
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure from the base pairs to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be able to move people out of their chairs and develop some activity activity to have more control of their health.
From the week next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people would crawl from their homes, to take their blood pressure, they will take their doctor and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume an position, they come back to <unk> and to be captains of their own <unk> but also help us care about health care because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of the care costs of <unk> <unk> and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like this, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did I'd like to share with you with you with a video.
We all have of navigation controls in the <unk>
Maybe we have our cell phones.
We know perfectly where the ATM <unk> are <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find food chains for fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked it, but no one will <unk>
No one knew where to get the <unk> saves life right now.
What we did was we made <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please say, <unk> where, when it is open, because sometimes you open up in <unk> <unk> and other people are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> already was introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an application for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you are in the city of <unk> and somebody <unk> can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks to use your cell phone from Microsoft to find the closest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to introduce this one, not just as <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we want to make it globally.
We are <unk> to all the colleagues in the world, at the other universities, to help us to find and work and act like a center for the <unk> of the <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and somebody <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us build these <unk>
It could be <unk> or <unk> <unk> for instance, to see if the <unk> that is actually shown in its place.
Please take care of this and not just to improve health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, it's photographs that you can't take with their cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at the age of 15.
I mixed with my passion before the drawing -- but it was a little bit different because when I used the camera and the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera, the process ends up when you press the <unk>
For me photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by press the <unk>
<unk> like this: a building on a very crowded road.
But it has a turn.
And even though it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful at time but with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say <unk> I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that I can <unk> but I always want you to look like it would have been caught in some way like photograph.
So I think that you will have to think a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to be able to capture an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them seem real?
It's the details or the <unk>
It will <unk> light?
What is it that creates the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is a perspective.
But at the end it is about how to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think it's realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we took different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here are three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But they combined in some ways can create something that still looks like <unk> as if we were there.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's move into the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really to combine different realities.
And the things that they make a picture looks like realistic I think they're those in which we don't even ignore the things around us in our daily lives.
But when you combine photographs is very important <unk> because otherwise something will be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to make realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the pictures <unk> must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> they took the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to do impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect love.
It has to be impossible to see where the picture.
Here's another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is totally comprised of photographs of different places.
In the staff, I think it's easier to create a place that will find it because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that are on your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in the winter I knew that I had several months to convince them to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a stone in stone.
And yes, I even made red the house at the top of the island to be more <unk>
So in order to get a realistic outcome of what I think is that we need planning.
It always starts with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures that the result can be very beautiful, and even very realistic.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing you a slide on technology, very boring.
Please do you <unk>
It's a diagram anybody who took from a portfolio of mine.
I'm not very interested in showing the details but the general side.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area networks.
The interesting thing about this is that this one, as many other things that we tend to see, is a straight kind of line on scale.
In other words, each step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale scale.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves is something new.
Here's something strange.
And that's just going to talk about that.
Please turn out the lights.
They were more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we solve technology curves for <unk>
The answer is that if you draw to a normal curve in which, say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to look at the diagram would look like something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you ask for example, some other technology, like transportation, it would be very silly, we would see a straight line.
But if something happens like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of the transport technology will be as fast as we could last last morning, we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go through that rhythm.
There is no precedent in the history of technological development of an <unk> growth that every few years advance of magnitude.
The question I want to do is -- to look at these curves <unk> we see that they don't forever.
You can't hold this change as fast as it goes.
We would take one of two things.
Or will become a typical curve -- I know how to come up something completely different, or maybe it will do something like this.
That's all it can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask myself, is, what is that new way you take the world?
What new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very confusing, if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future happened in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something that is going on.
That happens a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different than extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it could be, how that transition could be that <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have much to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is a distance and look at the long term.
So the scale of time I would like to do that is the time of life on Earth.
I think this picture makes sense if we look at every billion years.
So we go back about 2.5 billion years when the Earth was a great sterile rock with a lot of chemicals that <unk> around them.
If we look at the way that chemicals organize us, we give us a sense of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin of RNA -- I'm going to tell you a simple version of this and is that, at that time, there was a little bit of oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes on their inside.
Some of these oil droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that made them bring materials out of the outside of the outside and so trees grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the <unk> cell forms -- these oil <unk>
But those drops were not alive, in the current sense, because each of them contained a prescription of chemicals.
And every time they become <unk> <unk> a <unk> distribution of chemicals that are <unk>
So every single <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the drops that somehow <unk> being better at time to incorporate chemicals -- <unk> more chemicals and <unk> more.
Mostly, they lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, living chemistry, but things become interesting when these drops <unk> they learned the trick of <unk>
Somehow we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe in the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this meaningless evolution, a writing system that allowed them to figure out what they were in order to protect them.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, you have exactly the same code, that same <unk> system.
In fact, every living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have a hundred <unk> of white dust that I try to hide women's security people.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and put it back to the 22 times.
So if someone wants to be 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If I was a <unk> he would have put it in a virus and it would have spread in the room.
What was the next <unk>
To write DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy.
But then another big step occurred in which things are very different from which things were very different and that was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information and form information where cells are.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, for example, evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and <unk> to create their small DNA with other bacteria and now there are many resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to communities that, in a way, they were together in it, and a <unk>
From that way, or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals of that community became more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point occurred when these communities came up so much that, in fact, they came together and they decided to write all the recipe in the community together in a DNA chain.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have community communities, communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a community <unk>
We have lots of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell is not for the heart of the heart, or the muscle cell or the brain, and the brain, and the brain, so on.
So these communities evolved and became more interesting levels than cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that did not make more that process information in community.
These are the <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the <unk> structures of <unk> understanding and convey information.
Those were brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So, one organism, for example, learning not to eat some fruit because she knew bad and sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism that had been built up to these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that <unk>
So the fact that the nervous system would build those information structures that accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now develop confined to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick trick.
So, for example, the most <unk> version that we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, and I have a very complicated idea.
I'm sitting here emitting a few <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in their heads that keeps some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated that we turned into sound, in sound sequences and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as an humanity, we've started to perform <unk>
We now move through periods similar to the <unk> organisms -- our <unk> methods and data processing and information.
For example, the invention of language was a small step in that direction.
The computer <unk> the computer tape, <unk> and so forth, are the specialized mechanisms that we now built to handle that information.
And we aggregate that into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in <unk>
You already saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> in which some evolution has a certain evolution of <unk> to our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scales of time again.
The first stages of history I told you took a billion years from each other.
The next stage. The nervous system and the brain took about hundreds of millions of years.
The following, the language, and so on, took less than a million years.
And the next year, it seems to take just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that does its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we observe in this cross explosion.
We see the process <unk>
But I do my life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that work for jobs for us would not be possible without the technological technologies.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me.
I don't know that every transistor in that machine of connections.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think of a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine and the machine with that something you did not could, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes we use methods that we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using the next thing is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the <unk>
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million sequences of <unk>
You could run these items of instructions at chance, running all those programs, and take those of those that are more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we find the programs that are closer to order to order numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that a few random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers on the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did the <unk>
They were going to take those and get them to the rest.
And now I thought that I would better ordered the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, that <unk> <unk> and that the children will have the properties of both different programs.
So we got a new generation of programs from the combinations of programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please, repeat the <unk>
Let's get it again.
And we had a few mutations there.
And it's trying to try again and add to another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complex cases in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that are orders that orders in such a perfect way.
In fact, it's a much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to focus on how they work.
These are strange programs.
But they do the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the safety of the fact that they achieve because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that they succeeded.
In fact, their lives are dependent on doing this.
I once went on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he pulled out a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> airplane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> working together to offer a <unk> flight, it doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they get complicated.
So we start to depend on computers to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
But we don't understand the whole choices that there is.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make much faster computers, and so we can run these programs a lot more quickly.
So it means <unk>
The thing is getting faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at a moment analogous to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the turning point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think we all are part of the creation of what it is to come.
But now comes the lunch and I think I'm going to stop here before I <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that needs to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent time enough to allow me to give me part of my fake status on that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end of the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
And baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's going to go out <unk> <unk> speaks about the statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you know.
It's called an average of <unk>
And we talked about 300 of a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means that the <unk> bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the game of play without being <unk> and whatever anyone who tries to do to the first base is not going to come to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know what they call a <unk> of 300 in the Big <unk>
Well, actually, maybe the team of stars.
You know what they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, this is somebody that 10 <unk> get it out of four.
<unk> like rationality. Ted Williams, the last player from the Nobel League of <unk> to run more 400 hits in a regular season in a regular season.
Now I'm going to show you this to my world of medicine where I feel much more <unk> or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they are blinded to a surgeon who has also a record of 400 in <unk>
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a remote place and a wanted to have two arteries, <unk> <unk> and your family physician is derived by a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is <unk>
But you know what?
She's actually getting a sharp year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask you to ask them.
What do you think of it must be the average of hits a heart surgeon or a <unk> a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is sending them to the world, and I would say to me with the <unk> of being perfect.
We never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a student <unk> <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman I was studying to a blood I.Q.
<unk>
<unk> in my little <unk> at the <unk> <unk> at General <unk> at General <unk> not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my class of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of <unk> the diagnostic diagnosis and frequent <unk>
And I even knew the <unk> diagnosis of how to classify <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the more and more knowledge.
And I was very fine. I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> from the school of medicine with the impression that if you did everything, then you would know everything, or more possible to everything, because I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a university hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the lady in the emergency lady in the emergency service where I worked.
At that time, I was assigned to <unk>
And when the emergency room requested to a cardiologist I had to attend that patient.
And I report to the Chief <unk>
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a sound <unk>
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which was <unk> heart failure.
In these conditions the heart stops working and, instead of <unk> the blood forward, the blood goes to our lungs, these <unk> and that's why there's a difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I read him.
I gave aspirin and medication to relieve the pressure on your heart.
I gave him <unk> water pills so that I could get rid of it.
And in an hour or two, she began to feel better.
And I felt pretty well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I really made two more errors.
He sent her home without talking to the <unk>
I didn't get the phone and I did what I should have done, which was to call my boss and <unk> with him so that the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, he would have been able to provide <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident with a constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to assume <unk> that I could take care of my patients without even contact to my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When he sent it to his house, I didn't take a voice to a voice and say, <unk> it's not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so insecure that I asked the nurse who was taking care of the lady who was like, "Do you believe it's okay if he goes to his <unk>
And the nurse thought and then he said, "Yes, I think I'm fine."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed up, and the ambulance next with the ambulance who took her to her house.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach,
But I kept on my job.
At the end of the day, I was <unk> to leave the hospital and I walked into the parking lot where my car was going to go home. At that moment I did something I don't do normally, I don't do normally,
I went through the emergency emergency service service.
And there was another nurse, not that I was taking care of the lady was before, but another one told me three words, those three words that most of the emergency doctors will come back.
Other specialists fear as well, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and that is that we see patients <unk>
The three words are: it remembers you?
"Did the patient remember his <unk>
He asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the verge of death.
By an hour of an hour of getting back to his house, after I would give him the tall, he suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance brought her to the emergency room with a <unk> blood pressure of <unk> which means a shock of severe.
I would barely breathe and I was blue.
The emergency staff would spread all their resources.
They gave him medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mix of feelings because then the <unk> was in intensive therapy and waiting for all hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days it was clear that I never <unk>
He had <unk> brain damage.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, they were <unk> to what was happening.
And the ninth day, he left her to go. Mrs. wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The few weeks later, I was overwhelmed with it and experienced for the first time <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt just, <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't get it with your colleagues.
You make peace and never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
Shame is <unk> that I talk about is what makes us feel very bad about it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that felt.
And it wasn't because of my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I am sure that I was taking things to me, and I made sure that I didn't know me.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he send him home?
And in my worst <unk> Why did I made a mistake so <unk>
Why did I choose medicine?
Little to the feeling was <unk>
And I began to feel better.
And in one day, <unk> opened the sky, and finally came out the Sun, and I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I did a deal with me where if we were to give up the efforts to be perfect to not make any more mistakes, I would make those voices.
And he did.
I went back to work.
It was going to happen.
Two years later, he was an interview in the emergency department in a community hospital north of Toronto, and I got a man of 25 years with a pain in your throat.
I was very busy and <unk>
And he was going on here.
I looked into his throat, I was a little bit <unk>
He was diagnosed with penicillin and sent him to his house.
But as he went to the door he was still pointing out his throat.
Two days later, when I came to make my guard, my head asked to speak to me in his office.
And I gave the three words, you remember this?
Remember the patient who saw a pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially mortal condition called <unk>
You can Google them on Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but it can be an infection, and that it can cause the closing of those tracks.
He said, "I don't know.
They were getting antibiotics for antibiotics for <unk> and <unk>
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> and then I went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Two times at the same turn of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were <unk> 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't have sent home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a calculus <unk>
I had an X-ray of kidneys but it turned out to be normal.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read a liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to <unk>
I checked it and to notice some sensitivity in the bottom right-hand corner, called a surgeon.
They were both operated on and recovered well.
But every single case, I was <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
<unk> have been for the last five years.
They were embarrassed by embarrassed and not support.
And here's the problem: If I can't get myself and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I teach you this so that they don't make the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course, in a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you won't hear somebody talk about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues, I also knew a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- believe he would have difficulty looking at the eyes.
This is the system we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> which are the ones that make mistakes, and those who do not sleep that you can't sleep and the ones that I know.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as antibodies that start attacking that person.
We have the idea that if you take away from medicine to people who make mistakes, we have a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In about 20 years about <unk> and medical journalism -- I've done a personal study of bad medical <unk> medical medical and medical errors to learn as possible, from the first article that I wrote for the Star Trek article to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where errors are happening every day in which one in 10 drugs -- in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not right in a system where the infections are <unk> are increasingly <unk> and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, they killed 24,000 <unk> by medical errors <unk>
The U.S. Institute of Medicine, established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And that's what things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is divided every two or three years, and we don't get to <unk>
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with breath out to alcohol and all of a sudden, my story <unk>
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't pay their symptoms in the same way.
All of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like we <unk> and we eliminate all the drug professionals to error, well, not to get anybody.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> white <unk> white, art -- it's already a habit to say, "This is my worst <unk> I would say to everyone, from the people to the head of surgery, <unk> blah is my worst <unk> blah blah -- "What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone towards them.
And their students were <unk> <unk> <unk> head and <unk> saliva and started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
<unk> doctor is human, you know, the human, and it doesn't be proud of their mistakes, but it tries to try to learn from what happened to teach others.
We would have their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way, and support for everybody to be <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that humans run the system, and when this happens, they become mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk>
I'm a human, <unk> mistakes.
I feel a lot about it, but I have to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day.
Do you know how much we choose a week?
I recently did a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that says to choose an American American -- it's about 70 to a day.
Not a long way ago, in a research followed by a week of presidents of business.
The researchers recorded the different tasks that were governed by these executives and the time that we were trying to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs a week.
Naturally, every work included a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required one hour or more of your time.
Now think about your election.
Do you know how many they belong to the category nine minutes, and how many of the <unk>
How do you look at those <unk>
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choosing to the weight bill.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, as I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
In another way, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive, please give you a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, you're ready to hear about the problem of the <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this supermarket <unk> very, very sophisticated at least in that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to an amusement park.
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of the water <unk> and this was when we were taking water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but I was like, why don't I buy nothing?
This is a shelf from <unk> oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including those who were in a box <unk> that came from <unk> trees.
One time I decided to visit the manager and I asked him, <unk> this strategy of offering all of these <unk>
He pointed down to me full of tourists that came up every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had different kinds of different classes.
You know, a post to <unk> just to the entrance shop.
We put out there from six <unk> or 24 flavors and we looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop trying to test the <unk>
More people stopped when there was a <unk> that when there was only six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here we find the opposite effect.
What they stopped when there was 24, only three percent got to buy <unk>
When there were six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people were six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six.
Well, let's decide that we don't buy <unk> you probably have to make us <unk> less is good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the weight overload of choices are affecting us in very <unk>
We decided to not decide, even when this is not <unk>
Now the theme of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see decisions about savings for retirement for about a million Americans, from about 650 plans in this country.
We were interested in looking at whether the number of funds available on savings for retirement savings for retirement, the <unk> program will inspire people to save for the future.
And we found that there was a <unk>
We had plans that went from two to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger the number of funding was <unk> there were less participation.
So if you look at the extreme, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rate of participation was about 70 or more, not as high as I wanted to.
And in the plans that offered about 60 funds, the rate of participating in the 50th 1960s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there is more options, even in that case, there is negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the greater the number of choice, more people will be governed by avoiding actions or hedge funds.
As much more options, they were more willing to invest in financial care.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we have to do to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three negative consequences of the main things by providing more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that we make the decision that the decision is -- even when it goes against self-interest.
They are more likely to take the worst <unk> in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things less likely to pick up -- although you see it better.
The main reason is that we have to look at that wide variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations to make them a contrast and choose of that amazing <unk>
Today I want to propose to you four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so you can test in their businesses.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it has never been more true than today, that's less than now.
People are always bothered when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're looking at more and more is that if you choose to cut, you get to get rid of odd options, there will be a increase in sales, reducing the costs, there will be a better experience in the election.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When a corporation <unk> <unk> all the products for <unk> of cats who are less <unk> they increased the <unk> in <unk> by two <unk> higher sales and under costs.
You know that elementary school supermarkets have 45,000 products.
In a Walmart store there are about 100,000 products.
But the ninth store in the world now is <unk> and it provides only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce in the tin.
In the world of financial savings, I think one of the best examples that have emerged on how to handle choices is David <unk> by David <unk> the Harvard program.
All of the Harvard employees are forced to a safe fund of life.
Those who really want to choose, you give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
They often know that people often say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of them are <unk> choices.
The first thing I do is to ask the <unk> <unk> the differences there are between those options.
And if their employees can't afford it, you can't do it either.
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience with a holiday with all the paid paid to the world's most beautiful road.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you an applause if you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk> <unk> Good. Anyone who's ready to accept the deal.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that journey?
I think I really got to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information on the first <unk> than in the second one, but I can say that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images make it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the weight of the options.
For people understand the differences between choice, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must feel very much very concrete <unk>
Why is people spending 15 to 30 percent more on average when they use credit cards or credit cards that when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't look like real money.
It turns out to make it more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to save more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And to that meeting, we were going to look at exactly how we did, we did a little <unk>
What we added was that I would give you the staff to think about the positive things that they would do in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the number they were interested in saving or what they wanted to place in their accounts of <unk> <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study we did in a aisle of magazines.
We saw that I was in supermarket <unk> across the corridor of the magazines the magazines can contain from <unk> different kinds of different kinds of <unk>
But, you know?
Because the rating tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This scheme of classification is totally useless.
<unk> should tell you something to you who are not going to be <unk> not when they were <unk>
And so you often see this problem with those huge kinds of funding.
I am supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we thought, if only we would take it a little bit.
We need to increase the complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a good decision -- you buy it from a car.
This is a German car manufacturer that allows <unk> completely.
You have to take 60 decisions to put the car.
And these decisions.
<unk> color outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What I'm going to do is vary the order to make the decisions.
So half the clients are going to go from lots of options, 56 colors, a few four boxes.
The other half of the clients are going to go from a few options, four boxes, 56 colors, a lot of options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How involved you are.
If you get <unk> the default button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that those who are going from many choices to give you the default button over and over again, and another time.
The <unk>
If they go from a lot of choices to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was <unk> the order that the information is.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Even though we choose the box of changes don't tell you anything about the preferences of interior <unk> in all ways they are making us a choice.
We're excited about a product that we're building that now has more engaged us with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the overload of <unk> <unk> to eliminate alternatives to <unk> <unk> to do it <unk> we can handle more categories at least <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I've presented to them were designed to help handle <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their business, or for the people who are going to work.
It's that I think the key to get the best of a choice is being careful the <unk>
And the more careful we are in our best choices to be able to practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1980s, in the communist East Germany, if you had a typewriter that had <unk> to the government.
I had to register a piece of text of example written with the machine.
And this for the government could track the origin of <unk>
If they were written with the wrong message they could trace the footprint up to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, how much it would be, the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color printer from any big manufacturer and printing one page, that page will end up having some yellow dots on each page that follow a pattern that makes them just and from its printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be a lot about this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If you look at what happens in the online world can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups there.
Are you the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the <unk> to make a lot of money, a lot of a ton.
There are really many instances of <unk> online, <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthieu Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys do their online <unk> but they do it by illegal media through <unk> <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we bought in <unk> or steal our keys from our cards when we bought on a computer <unk>
The American secret service of the United States two months ago, <unk> <unk> from this guy, Sam <unk> and this counts had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you know your <unk>
And I say today it's more likely than any of us being a victim of a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong with worse.
In the future, most online crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance today is not driven by the money.
There's another thing that moves, they motivate them, the protests, they motivate them, they motivate them laughter.
Those groups like Anonymous have been <unk> in the last 12 months in the past 12 months in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> criminals who make it for money, <unk> as Anonymous that they do to protest and the last group are the United national the national governments that we had.
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of heart attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is an authority of the Netherlands -- or, actually, it was.
They will collapse last fall because of a <unk>
Let's take the safety of the site and make it a <unk>
Last week I said, in a meeting with the Dutch government representatives I asked one of the leaders if they were born, they <unk> death of people from the attack to <unk>
And the answer of he was yes.
So how do people die of a attack of these?
<unk> is an <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
So what are the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except that we had a foreign authority authority.
And they were starting to be able to write <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it was exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, Egypt in Egypt, the <unk> <unk> headquarters in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found many papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes of a company based on Germany that had sold the Egyptian government to intercept the communications of citizens in the country.
They had sold this tool for 280 euros to the government <unk>
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide the tools for governments to get them to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by official government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious of a criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
The connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and to listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think about a little bit of things like these the obvious answer should be said, "Well, it's a bad thing, but I really don't affect because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to do it.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could be confident that we can trust our governments today in 2011, any right now that we spend today, will be forever.
Let me rotate in any future government, in a management that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that are worried about the next 50 years.
So here is where I live in Kenya, in the south of National Park.
These are the cows of my dad, to the background, and behind the cows, the National Park of Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no <unk> in most of the south, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate out of the park.
And predators, like the lions, they follow them, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and as soon we wake up in the morning and found it dead and felt very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and so we value them.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of lions.
They were dying they protect our community and the cattle, and they're also upset with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think that's why there are so few in the National Park of Nairobi.
A child in my community, from six to nine years is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that was happening to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions was fear.
But I realized that this is actually not <unk> because it even helped the lions to see the pen on a distance.
I didn't mean <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
It was trying to trick the lions so they believed that he was near the <unk>
But male lions are very smart --  they came up the first day and saw the <unk> and they were gone, but the second day, they came back and said, this thing doesn't move, it's always here.  So she jumped and they killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day, lions didn't come back.
I discovered that lions are afraid of the light that's moving.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on which to turn out the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a broken <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar panel load the battery and the battery to <unk> the electricity to the little box <unk> I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box makes the lights down.
As you can see, the <unk> give out, because that's where the lions.
And that's how you see what lions do when they come from night.
<unk> lights and <unk> the lions so you think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never had trouble with lions.
And the homes in the neighborhood heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals, the lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see the <unk> You can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've set them in seven houses in my community, and they are serving a lot of a lot.
And my idea is also used by all Kenya, <unk> to <unk> other predators like <unk> <unk> and it's also using for <unk> elephants from farms.
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a grant on one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping raise money and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community and we installed lights in the houses that don't have it, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a kid in vaginas in the savanna <unk> my father's cows and used to see airplanes flying and said that someday I would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got an opportunity to come on plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to become an engineer of aviation and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you get a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions here.
What's the next one in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do one near electric <unk>
<unk> I know you invented electric <unk> but I want to do mine.
CA: So I would give you once, right, and <unk> <unk> I have tried it before, but I couple because I got a <unk>  CA: The foot of the cannon. Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We are going to <unk> in every single step that I had my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "Not <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we passed, all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> story, but we never learned much of the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, are the enemies.
Even though I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until it all changed a while.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public performance.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That said, "When we did this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we have not eaten in the last two weeks.
We're <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, that we're ready to die."
I was very <unk>
I was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
A little while, when I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead on the street, holding a child <unk> in her arms looking at the face of his mother without able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine in North Korea in the middle of the <unk>
In the end, more than a million North Koreans died during the famine and just a few survived eating grass, insects and tree cortex.
They were also made more and more often the energy <unk> all around me was completely dark at night except for sea lights in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at the night compared to the countries.
This is the <unk> river that serves to limit North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North America to cross <unk>
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating in the river, of the river, right?
I can't tell you the details of how I got out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of hunger, I was sent to China to live with <unk>
But I just thought that I would be separated from my family for a short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like refugee <unk>
But soon enough, I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but it's dangerous because the refugee refugees in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was made when I was arrested for the Chinese police and <unk> me at the police station.
Somebody had been accused by being <unk> then I had my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to exploit.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer told another, "This was a fake report. She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North America are looking for asylum in <unk>
But many may be arrested for the Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although there were any <unk> had eventually released after the harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> incarcerated or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to get away a lot of other North Koreans haven't been so lucky.
It's tragic that the North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all of the world can be embedded in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hide my identity, I decided to sleep by going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I expected to.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
I realized that there was a big gap between North and South America.
We're all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even went through an identity crisis.
I'm <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country I could call with a pride of mine.
Even though I went to life in South Korea was not easy, I did a plan. I started studying for the credit exam to college.
Just when I was starting to go back to my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korea, the North Korea authorities were sent to my family, and as a punishment -- my family was going to be shifted to force to a location out of the <unk> in the <unk>
They had to run away.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to <unk> in a way, for over 3,000 miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we almost got caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and addressed by a Chinese police officer.
He asked you to ask them some questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be <unk>
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and told him that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and <unk> my family was released in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the most low spots in my life.
I did all for releasing my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison in South Korea.
I was going to come between the <unk> office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man ask myself, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the ATM -- and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans and <unk>
I read it with all my heart, and I asked her, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
<unk> <unk> a new hope for me and for the village to <unk> when they were more <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the village <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But their freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with a little bit of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practical practices, of the English language, and so on.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us keep in contact with family contact, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea.
I've been very <unk> I've received a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North America a chance to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Korea, all over the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Center.
This is <unk> <unk> stores <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And so the city planners came together and they thought, we're going to change the South Center name so that it represents something else, so they changed the Los Angeles to South America, as if this <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles South Africa, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Just like <unk> million other Americans, live in a food desert, Los Angeles Center home for food places to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that food places to take more people killing food than food in the car.
People are dying of heart disease, in Los Francisco Center.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times greater than say, Beverly <unk> who's like 15 miles away.
I'm going to tell you that this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go home you see the effects that the current food system has in their <unk>
I see <unk> <unk> and sold like cars <unk>
I see centers of <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this has to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
I also got tired of about driving 45 minutes back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 me x 3 feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to <unk>
I said, "Well, I can do what I come in wins, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided to <unk>
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we put us together and we started planting our forest of food, trees -- you know, the nine <unk>
What we do, we are a kind of <unk> <unk> set of gardeners of all the <unk> of all the city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city sat on me on top and summary I gave me a <unk> saying that I had to take my garden, the <unk> made it <unk>
And I said, "Come on, in right?
A running order of running food on a piece of land that no one <unk>  So I was like, "Okay, let's <unk>
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> members who put a petition on <unk> with 900 <unk> we went a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> I even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more <unk>
It has <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's equivalent to 20 <unk>
That's enough space for planting billion plants of tomato plants.
Why the hell does it look like this?
<unk> a plant will give a thousand, 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars to a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, <unk> your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Center.
I grew up there. I grew up my children there.
I was going to be part of this <unk> reality, which was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to show you my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I culture my art.
As an artist <unk> artist <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden garden, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You will be surprised to see what land can do, if you let their canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm witness to how my garden became an education tool in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of land.
We are the land.
You will be surprised to see how they affect kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> and provocative act.
Also, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion, that they came up and her daughter, were like the <unk> on the night and they were in my garden, I went out and looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I saw people who were so close to hungry, and this only reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes that people will steal your <unk>
And I say, "Oh no, I don't have to be afraid they go to <unk>
So that's in the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to take, but at your time, I want you to <unk> your <unk>
There was another time that I put a garden in a homeless shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, they shared his stories about how this had affected them and how they used to plant their mom and her grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed it, so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people who come from, work and <unk> all of a volunteer plan.
If kids grow <unk> the kids will eat <unk>
If you grow tomatoes, they'll eat <unk>  But if none of these are <unk> if you don't teach them how food affects the mind and the body, they eat blind what you put in front of you.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which I see these guys from color that are on this path designed for them, which doesn't lead them nowhere.
With <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids who are <unk> from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe there's the next George Washington Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of land, we will never change it.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take <unk> and turn them into healthy towns.
I don't know.
I'm not talking about free, because the free is not sustainable.
The curious thing about sustainability, is that you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to put people out of the street, to get kids out of the street, who know the joy, and the pride and the honor of growing their own food, by opening their own food, opening markets.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everybody to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We have to change the script of what is a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Can you take them to take your <unk> OK?
That is their weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, you don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me where this is a very <unk> road <unk>
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days as today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water on the asphalt that we <unk>
And especially if you go into your bike and these cars go off, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we would want a silent road.
The solution to that is to do road from asphalt asphalt roads.
The asphalt asphalt is a material that we use right now in most roads in the Netherlands, and the water can go through it, so that all water can flow up to the sides and have a road that is easy to drive, and not water is going to be <unk>
The noise will also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very hollow, that all the noise disappear, so it's a very silent road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> You see that in this road rocks in the surface of the surface <unk>
First of all, a stone, then then several more and more and more, etc., and then then -- well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can hurt it and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create bumps with that.
Oh. It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see the damage in this material.
It's one asphalt asphalt as I said, so it only has a little bit of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they're <unk> they will become <unk> and <unk>
So if you drive on the road, they will take the <unk> you look like it here.
To solve this problem, we think about materials of <unk>
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is to use knitting <unk> of that to clean <unk> and we can cut the steel wool into very small bits, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel wool in it.
And then you need a machine, like the one you see here, you use to make it <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat apart, especially steel is very good at that.
So what you have to do is to heat the steel to melt the <unk> the <unk> flow through these <unk> and the stones go back to the surface.
Now I used an oven, because I can't bring the great <unk> machine here to the stage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the sample, which I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the show that it comes out.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples there and then the government, they really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we donated a piece of road -- 400 feet of the <unk> highway <unk> where we had to make a test lane to test this material.
So that's what we did in there, you see where we were doing the test on the road, and then of course, this road is going to last several years without any harm. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We made a lot of the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, we put them together with our <unk> machine and the <unk> and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we have made a material using steel fibers bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life on the surface of the road, you can even double the life of the surface. It's actually saving a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they're curious about if this also worked.
We still have the show here. It's pretty hot.
You actually have to cool first before I can show you how it acts the repair of it.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up with a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening BBC <unk> in his little gray radio.
I had a great smile on his face that was unusual at those times, because the news is usually <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> I told me.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were taken out of Afghanistan and they did illegal for girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was inspired as a kid to get my older sister to my older sister who could no longer be outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way we could have the two we could <unk>
Every day, we would take a different route for anybody to suspect where we were headed.
We had to hide the books on market bags.
The school was in a house, over 100 of us in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but it's extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that we had our <unk> the teacher, students and our parents.
Once in a while, school was a sudden for a week, because the Taliban were <unk>
We always wondered what they did.
They were <unk>
Did you know where it is.
We were <unk> but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for her time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan -- where his daughter, my mother, go to school and for that his father is <unk>
But my educated mother became a teacher.
This is it.
He went back two years ago, just to convert our home home to girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk>
For him, there was a better risk in not to educate their children.
In the years of the <unk> I remember there were moments where I was very frustrated about our life, and I was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to quit, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can let them leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will do that.
So, you still want to do it.
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women of my age have more than the high school, and if my family had not been as committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate in <unk>
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> their home by the courage to educate her daughters, it was one of the first in <unk>
He was not just <unk> from my college degree, but I was also the first woman, and I'm the first woman, I wear it on the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador, and a global campaign to educate women.
This is why <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to take advantage of the opportunity.
And I see his parents and their families who, like my mine, <unk> for them, despite the way in front of a <unk> opposition in the face of the opposition there.
As <unk> It's not their true name, and I can't show you his face, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went from road to her village, and they literally escaped to be killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to his house, you are the phone, a voice gave him that if I kept sending his daughter to school, they would get it again.
<unk> now, if you <unk> he said, "but it doesn't harm the future of my daughter for his old <unk>
What I've given me from Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of those who are <unk> there's a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that success of her own success.
It doesn't mean our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they are often the first <unk> compelling future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school in <unk> remember, was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan is so different from here in the United States.
I find that Americans see the fragility of the changes.
We thought that these changes didn't make a lot, after the retirement of the U.S.
But when I look back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who were going to go through them, that the <unk> I see a future <unk> and financial change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for me, and every day, the girls of <unk> I would tell me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never go back a revolutionary <unk> style.
They've spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution was inspired by the surge of mass <unk> so much of the revolution called <unk>
One forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call a day of anger and start a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And the <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men -- young men were in the edge, <unk> the each of the regime, they are struggling with freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown an courage to face the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of the brutal war and a few losses about 50 thousand dead, we were able to release our country and <unk> to the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy charge, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I have dear to do, along with many other women, to rebuild civil society -- <unk> a transition and just to the right towards democracy and national reconciliation
There are about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> About 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of Medicine I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm -- I started organizing workshops about the development of capabilities and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women we founded the <unk> of Women <unk> by <unk> a <unk> of women leaders, very <unk> orientation to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and for our personal involvement <unk> in the construction of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was increasingly <unk> which is <unk> from the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was goals and successful.
The women won a <unk> of the National Congress in 52 years.
However, a little bit, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of the old mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day with the news of the murder of American <unk> and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder murder of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their brother's <unk> human rights violations and their lack of respect of law.
Our society, created by a <unk> mindset becomes more, and it's been away from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, which we had at the beginning.
The <unk> the <unk> and the revenge became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today to deal with our history of the success of <unk> <unk> and elections.
I'm more here today to confess that we, as a nation, we choose wrong, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because elections didn't brought peace, the stability and security to Libya.
The list of <unk> and the <unk> between candidate and reconciliation, brought in peace and reconciliation
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and <unk> as much for men as for women?
Perhaps what was missing was not just women, but the women's values of compassion, <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than what the election needed the election and just to look at the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs the women's representation of the female that you need a representation and quantitative representation of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of anger and call days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech that not just <unk> but also put the <unk> instead of <unk> the collaboration instead of competition, the inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> for war, desperately needs to be in order to achieve peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between female perspectives and the male perspectives.
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known to all the <unk> traditions -- has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> female and <unk> that spans the entire humanity of the men and women, that all tribes and all the peoples have <unk>
And so just like the uterus completely covers the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion -- all of the existence.
So he says, "My <unk> does it go through all the things."
So you say, "My <unk> prevalent about my <unk>
They were all going to give you the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a spooky question, which has an equal answer.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is what they all make is that they all do the eternal thing. Why is she left?
Why was somebody going to stay with a man who <unk> him.
I'm not a psychiatrist, no worker, no social worker, no choice in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story that count.
I was 22 years old, I had just <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City by my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> green <unk> <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I create my soul <unk> I would love my head with a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The man who loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a Machiavellian <unk> of love, where every year they fall down every year -- and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> <unk> between those Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington Washington <unk>
I have almost 20 years old with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and drive a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all the races, all of the <unk> every of the income levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse only happens in <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> or, in another way, in the families, the last place where we want to or expect that domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who would sit with a man who hits him, and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States women ages between 16 and 24 years old, have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other time, and more than 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by couples, <unk> and husbands in the U.S.
I also was a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or its patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold, rainy night of January.
I was sitting next to my side in New York City and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just been <unk> from a college of <unk> <unk> and working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first meeting was that it was ready and fun, and that seemed like a <unk> guy.
He had some big <unk> as apples, and a <unk> and wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of my mate.
He did it about everything in the beginning <unk> in a <unk>
We started out and loved everything from me, that I was ready -- that I had gone to Harvard, I'd put a passion in helping girls and my work.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> I believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, like nobody had ever done it.
And it was why I was in that <unk> school and the job in Wall Street and his bright future had so much importance for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went from New York to leave my dreams, but I thought that I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I was going to let me quit my work and <unk> and I went together to Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering a <unk> and financial trap and carefully <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts to it.
And this is where those guns.
And as soon as we moved to New England -- you know, that site where I was supposed to <unk> it had to feel so safe and bought three guns.
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another one kept it underneath the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns to cause the trauma that they lived with a kid.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message to me, and even though I had never lifted up my hand, my life was already serious and every minute every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my mom from my mother and married him.
Despite what had happened. I was sure that we were living happily forever, because I loved it, and he also wanted me a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
There were just a really good sense of <unk> for the wedding and the fact that they would form a family with me.
He had been an isolated accident, and I had never been able to hurt me.
I spent two times more on our moon.
The first time I was driving to a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that I would sing several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back on the moon of honey, they went through the traffic and threw me on a Big Mac cold to the face.
<unk> kept <unk> one or twice a week for the next two years and the middle of our marriage.
I was amazed when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One in three American women is a victim of domestic violence or <unk> at some point in their life, and the Control Center for Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had a very good company.
So to go back to my question: Why do I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman, in love with a deeply <unk> man -- and it was the only person in the world that I could help <unk> to cope with their <unk>
The other question that everybody does is, why are they just not <unk>
Why not <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we have the victims, we know something that normally you <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is to kill her.
More than 70 percent of the killings in cases of domestic violence occur after the victim ever put the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include the permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has become married, <unk> for financial resources, and manipulation of the family court system to protect the victim and their children, who are normally forced by judges to spend time not <unk> with the man who killed his mother.
And we still ask why it's simply not going?
I was able to go away, because of one last <unk> I was going to beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, I would have killed me if you had allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everybody across the world: the police, my neighbors and my friends and family and family and full of strangers, and I'm here today because all of you are <unk>
We have the tendency to <unk> victims like <unk> <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why are you <unk>
For some people it's a way to say, "The fault is it by <unk> as if the victims <unk> intentionally <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I posted <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also claim that they learned a decent lesson from what happened to them and to embrace their lives joyful and happy lives and happy lives and mothers, lives completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I am actually a victim and a survivor of domestic violence, very typical domestic violence.
I went back to marrying a cute little man, and we have these three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to come back to have ever more, ever is a closed pistol pointing to my head in the hands of somebody who wants to tell me.
At this moment, they are thinking, "Wow, that's <unk> or <unk> which is <unk> but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, which are being <unk> or they were <unk> they were <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting their daughter to her sister, to her best friend right now.
I was able to end up my particular love <unk> breaking silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last petition to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> thrives only in silence.
They have the power to end up with domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
Take the abuse of the light talking about it with their children, their friends and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors as amazing people and <unk> who have a future <unk>
They were going to get the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
Together, we can turn our beds, our <unk> our families and our families in the most safe <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be accurate for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this point, there's a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have been dressed in this way.  So luckily, I brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first of clothes on a stage of <unk> so you have a lot of luck of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when you die, they don't have to get them now, but I would find out later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think of me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to pass this sweater through the head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything while I cover my head.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope that not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed what they thought about in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer would tell me that I was going to get the back to the back and that he <unk> the hair of the child.
Of course, safe with surgery or an artificial <unk> like the one I did two days ago for work, there are very little that we can do to transform our looks, which, although shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave that it means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model for me.
Because I'm a nice white woman, white, and in my workforce, that's a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how is it going to be model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> I was discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic temple, and I am the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this inheritance.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as <unk> and youth and symmetry, which we are biologically programmed to <unk> also we've associated with a high and <unk> shape, and a white skin.
And that's my <unk> that I have learned to take money to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience that now show up, and maybe there are some <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> There are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for knowing so much of models. It's amazing.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York said all and every single model of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models, which is just less than four percent, they were not white ...
The next question that people always ask me is: Does it be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't care about that.
But then, what would I really tell you to each one of these girls is: Why? You can be whatever you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you would be the first.
If after this spectacular list, still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the head of <unk> <unk> <unk> or the <unk> executive of <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you need to be a model that is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you have the studies, your studies, and you have a sample and a little bit of jobs to your backs, no matter what you can do, you know, if you think that you want to be president of the United States, but your drawing is <unk> of underwear for 10 years, people would look at you.
The next question that people always do is if all the pictures are <unk>
And yes, it's pretty much <unk> all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I came up with -- and the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal terrain.
So I looked at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a feast party a few days before the photos for French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and in British magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize that I'm not me in those photos.
These are creations of a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all of their <unk> and people of <unk> and <unk> and achieve this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is, <unk> things for free?
I have too many <unk> and I have never use, except the couple before, but the privilege I get are the ones I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a shop and I forgot to wear money, and I was given the dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped in red -- and of course, <unk> and <unk> -- I'm sorry, agent for being able to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privilege by my looks, not for what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their aspect no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, from <unk> teenagers who were couple and 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
I mean, how many times I am obsessed with me.
So when we investigate this talk, I found out that to the 53 percent of the age of 13 years in the United States they don't like their body, and that figure up to 78 percent of the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is: If you're a little bit thinner and you have the most bright hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe you can do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also amazing to be able to work with creative creative people, ingenious and <unk>
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my day every day.
And if you can ever ask, with a little smaller legs and the <unk> hair.
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most <unk> legs and <unk> and <unk> but probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But most of it was difficult to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something that will retain this talk, I hope everyone will feel more comfortable in recognizing the power of the image of the picture that we have about success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was older enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 pictures more <unk> and I didn't go and I don't know the <unk>
There were no directors, no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the photos, not even a minimum of care in lighting.
In fact, most of them gather a random <unk>
My story starts when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of <unk> and 5.
He gave the accident that we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my wife and said, why don't you take you to go to New York City on a <unk> journey.
Here is when we started asking the tourists that they were going to make us <unk>
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete unknown is so universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, no one has ever been <unk> with the camera.
So we were not aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day as a five-year-old would have happened to be understood.
These pictures are much more than representations of a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop the time in a week of October, and we think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not just to the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we always take the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter has new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how you perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something that we hope for illusion all the year.
So recently, in one of the trips we were walking, when all of a sudden, it was stopped in my tracks and pointed out a red <unk> of the toy store that <unk> from small in the previous visits to before.
And it described me what felt like the five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> that reminded her heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things that we create is the memories.
So, I want to share the idea of being active in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but besides these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I am always the one that leaves the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and I didn't get to go on and get closer to somebody and ask him, and you take a <unk>
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the <unk> group.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney <unk> <unk> like <unk> silly dumb characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that relate to Parliament <unk> but I don't accept.
I don't accept. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep the environment.  The <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   You're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World that are mostly found in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the World <unk> where we have 16 species of these 16, 11 countries face a high risk of extinction.
So, why are we <unk> they're important -- first of all, they provide vital ecological services.
They're our natural <unk>
<unk> the cadavers to the bone.
They help all be able to kill all the bacteria they help absorb anthrax that of not being driven and causing great loss of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> people take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge historical importance.
They've been associated with the ancient <unk> culture.
<unk> was the symbol of the lip and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the UN and Under Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> of the Tasmanian devil <unk>
In <unk> culture, they do a few very important <unk> to open sky in places like <unk> there is no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination of <unk>
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, of which six are at extreme <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason that they're being <unk> is because there is conflicts between humans and <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the endangered endangered list, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years is <unk> and the reason is because they fall prey from livestock consumption, which has been treated with a drug <unk> like <unk>
This drug has been banned for granted, in India and they've taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of <unk> dogs in <unk> of <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs -- you have a huge pump of time to <unk> the number of anger has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in South Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up with the <unk> lake.
I'm not against wind, but we have to work with governments, because turbines turbines turbines do this to the birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk>
In West Africa, there is a horrible trade of dead <unk> to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're looking at these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel by different countries, so to focus on a problem locally is not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments at the regional levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we have.
How can they help? It can become assets, making noise. They can write a letter to your government and tell them we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you go out of this room, you will report on the <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on their <unk>
These are very <unk> Charles Darwin said it changed because he saw it fly without energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorer without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young people, but I'm not.   I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Coast of <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
It <unk> the <unk> that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Rather than that, everything we played on it.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where I was Italians we decided to teach people in Zambia to grow food.
So we get with seeds <unk> south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the river <unk> and teaching the local local and grow tomatoes and Italians and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they would tell them to come to work, and sometimes they were not going to be <unk>  We were late in the time that the local, in so fertile valley, they didn't have had agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we didn't do anything, we just said, "Thank God that we're here."  <unk> time to save the people in Zambia from the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown up.
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato would grow to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> Look at the <unk>
When tomatoes were <unk> <unk> and red <unk> at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> showed up from the river and ate it.
And the <unk> said, "Yeah, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you hear it, "You're never <unk>
I thought that only of us would Italians say mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, they did what the people were doing -- and then to see what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> to see the <unk>  <unk> to look at the waste that we gave up to <unk> people in Africa.
She wants to read a book, I read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors -- we've given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not telling you about the damage that the money has <unk>
They just read their book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries is an <unk> missionaries and treat people just two things: or <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I treat any of a different culture as if they were going to be my kids, I want you a lot."
<unk> I treat all of them in a different culture as if they were going to be my <unk>
So the white in Africa are called <unk> boss.
That book gave me a slap in my face, "The Little <unk> written by <unk> who said for all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first beginning of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the floor and said, we can -- you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided to go to the 27 years to just respond to people, and invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you're ever going to ever bring anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? They <unk>
It never comes to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from the offices.
We put together in a coffee. We put together in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give someone an idea.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do that?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we helped them find knowledge because no one in the world can succeed alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what it wasn't, for once, for once, but not in <unk> meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the <unk> meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell you, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what a chance have had to do with their own money, what a chance have they found.
So, planning has this point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know about it, because they don't go to their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face -- you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You should create a new profession.
The profession is the family physician in the company, the family physician in the business, who sets up with you in your house, at the table of her kitchen, and that helps him find the resources to transform their passion in a way of making a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get away from this <unk> <unk> where we got to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects on going, and the government came to me to ask, "How can you do that?
How can I do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very difficult.
And I was going to give you a <unk>   So the government says, <unk> again.  So we've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the most strong business imaginative business in the story, passed away from '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says, <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a company of company <unk>
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the business <unk>
So now we <unk> reconstructing <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk with you.
You have to offer you <unk> privacy, privacy, it has to be great to the <unk> and then you're going to come up in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you show -- you know, more this tomorrow?
People who are local people. That's what you have <unk>
So what I'm saying is that the spirit spirit is where it is.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution, the fossils of the <unk> fossils and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of sustaining <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who's going to invent the technology for the green revolution, the <unk>
<unk> <unk>
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There is a funny story that I read in a paper magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the <unk>
And in the last year, they got together this group of people -- and I was interested in what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population is growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to <unk>
They were already <unk> in dung.  So, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that we <unk> the life of New York.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States in the United States, <unk> manufacturers were <unk> <unk>
So the idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very examples, <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
But there's a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
In another way, they won't come to talk with you.
Then you have to offer no absolute <unk>
And then then you will have to tell you the truth with respect to <unk>
The smallest company, the biggest company has to be able to do three things: <unk> the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to tell a fantastic marketing and you have to tell you with a great financial administration.
Guess what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that I can do, to sell and look for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked at the <unk> and looked at the 100 icons of the <unk> <unk> <unk> Ford -- all the new companies -- Google, <unk>
There is only one thing that all the companies successful in the world have in common -- just one: None of it was started by one person.
The word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it started.
Nobody begins a company alone. Nobody.
So, we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in <unk> in <unk> alongside their dedicated dedicated <unk> who will do for you, what someone made about this gentleman who talks about this <unk> someone who talks to you, what do you get?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can see it, you can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." <unk>
We build communities.
Thank you.
Those of us around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't shift much knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how long they pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door on <unk>
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share our hopes for the cows stores so that our communities can reflect our own needs and <unk>
I live in New York <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> who give a shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
And there is a <unk> in New York <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful projects in the world, but also one with the largest number of abandoned property of America.
I live near this house and I thought how it could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
His death was sudden and she was unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and <unk>
And this led me a deep gratitude for the lived time.
It clearly gives the significant things in my current life.
But I would try to keep this look in my daily lives.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to catch up the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant board and he painted on her phrases for <unk> Before he died <unk>
So <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment but the next day the wall was filled and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I die I want to be <unk> for <unk>  Before I die I want to sit on the line of <unk>
Before I die I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I die I want to plant a <unk>
Before I die I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I die I want to get it once more."
Before I die I want to go to the rescue rescue.
Before I die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hopes of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's trying to understand our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about giving the reflection of the reflection and the <unk> and to remember what is the most important thing for us as we grow and change it.
This happened last year and I began to receive hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center, we did a kit and now have got walls in countries around the world, like Kazakhstan, South Africa, Argentina and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces if we give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of long-term distractions that are more important than ever before, to find ways to maintain the perspective and remember that life is short and delicate life.
The death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that are going to make us more power.
Think of the death of the death of our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect what we care about as individuals and as a community and with more means to share hopes and stories, the people around us cannot help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 and very hot.
I don't speak, but it tells you joy that some of the best <unk>
<unk> knows what the love.
You share it -- it's going to happen what will happen.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious differences and notice about this: it's never <unk>
When singing songs from our childhood, trying to say words that I couldn't even <unk> it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and the wonderful thing that must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very hot.
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year that each of the songs came out of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, I would have a pee on my arm during the first episode of Lady <unk>
It doesn't seem amazing?
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the notion of normal society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what I propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although you wouldn't consider them within it, that could only mean one thing that were autistic and autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a brain disorder affecting social communication, learning and sometimes the physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself in a different way, which is so different to Sam.
And around the world, every 20 minutes, is to be diagnosed with autism, and even though it's one of the disorders of development that faster in the world, there is no cause or cure for <unk>
I don't remember my first meeting with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was only three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When they spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play as the other babies and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
I was living in his own world, with his own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the cars in row around the room, looking out of the washing machine, and eat anything that was <unk>
As I grew up more different, and the differences were made more <unk>
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the endless hyperactivity had something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature -- a child to see the world with no biases, a human being that there was never <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some tough moments in my family, moments that I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they are things that would not want to change the normal.
<unk> passes through the top of the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that one is wrong.
It just means that there's a different view of what's right.
If I could <unk> one single thing to <unk> and Sam and you, it would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift in their inside and, honestly, the pursuit of normality, is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the time where we are trying to be each other.
Please. Don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what has been to be <unk> in the <unk>
Penn State asked me a teacher to communications, a kind of communication to students of engineering.
I was scared.  <unk> <unk> of these students with their great minds, their big books and their big <unk> words.
But when those conversations, I felt what it was -- there must have felt like when it was the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt when I had these conversations with the students. I was surprised by the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are attacking our biggest challenges -- from energy to environment and health care, and if we don't know we don't understand this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these great conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please go through <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that you can see that their science is sexy and their engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
You don't just tell us that we study <unk> but study <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing your science, care with the <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same as making stupid ones.
Instead, as Einstein, that everything is as simple as possible, but it's not simple.
They can communicate clearly your science without compromise with ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies. They are ways and <unk> with their content.
And by presenting his work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you asked why they call <unk>  What do they do? bullets kill them, and they would take their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's serving too much in the language of our brain and we get to us.
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of the <unk> is so strong that it actually inspired the only design of the <unk> Tower, <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple <unk> <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit of a bit, and then you will provide graphs that will inspire our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what it is <unk>
I think these are just some keys that can help others open the door and see the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've fixed this equation, all of the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words about the Oxford English <unk>
Just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an <unk> editor of the 19th century that defined it much better when he said, "A <unk> is that he searches for a public <unk> no matter party or <unk> or very beginning, and that, when you put it for the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to master language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the <unk> name of <unk> <unk> who faced the <unk>
They put her on the Tower of London and <unk> him but he had enough courage to cope with them, and at the end had such popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> as well as the <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's by an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So they had to tackle the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
You didn't know that.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They had all kinds of suggestions that you might have <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> of state <unk> and others, "Your <unk> -- George <unk> and other <unk> from the U.S. People <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was <unk>
And not even with that they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a fixed date.
And I could have <unk>
Everybody got tired <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the day of a poor <unk> and always <unk> not with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to be <unk>
They didn't want to call it the King of her or his <unk> ideas.
So they wanted to give the most <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that they came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. It didn't invent the title. There was it before, but it just meant <unk> that I would have a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were presidents of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a insignificant.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who would take a serious thing with a very ridiculous title and <unk> as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate is not <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite way to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> the title of President.
President Barack Obama has to keep there, waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> you can go ahead and get them to <unk>
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and with this -- I want to show you that the title of President of America doesn't sound at all as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads at disposal, the largest economy in the world and a fleet of air <unk> and so on.
The reality and history have endowed the title of <unk>
So at the end he won the <unk>
<unk> their title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, was a uniqueness for then.
But you know how many nations they have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end the Senate won and the House of <unk> <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you say that they're now the President of <unk>
And I think that's the big lesson we can learn, and what I would like to do with you.
The politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but actually actually change a lot more the words more the words than these could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to meters under the ground in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is <unk> and dust, and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak about but, above all, that cacophony of <unk> male and stones were <unk>
Like others, I carry a cheap <unk> of light -- he supports his head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely tell the <unk> the branches that hold the walls of that <unk> hole in the ground.
It was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met days before, and he lost control and fell down a mile in that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are deep in that hole in their risking their lives without paying a reward and often dying.
I walked out of that hole and I went home, but they may never do it because they're prey from slavery.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents and in 2009, and in 2009, I had the great honor to be the only <unk> in the <unk>
Between all the amazing people that I met there was <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO who has gone to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world but not just like grade.
When we ended up talking to me and I was very honest and honestly I was trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me feel a stomach <unk> and weeks later, I flew Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offered my help.
So my journey began my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, it had been in many of these places.
A few of the ones I thought about my second home.
But this time, <unk> dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are now over 27 million people in the world.
It's twice as much as the number of Africans displaced all of the slave slaves are <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer, a farmer was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 dollars today.
However, today, you can enslave entire families for generations by 50 percent of <unk>
<unk> slavery generates profit from over 13 billion dollars a year across the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work to find that they are forced to work without pay, under threat to violence and can't escape.
Today slavery operates in <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but those are producing them are disposable ones.
<unk> exists in almost everybody and yet it's illegal throughout the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the blast furnaces in India.
This strange show was how to go into the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> at the temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, kids, in fact, family families -- in a heavy cycle of <unk> mechanically mechanically bricks in their heads, until 18 to the time, and they lead to hundreds of feet.
<unk> for <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no lunch to eat, not to drink, and the severe <unk> made it <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the powder that my camera became too hot to touch and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team, and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and, sitting there, I thought my camera is getting a lot better than these people.
Back in the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was at my quickly quickly grabbed me and said, "I don't know it. Don't do it here."
And he explained to me very clearly that <unk> emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me, but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I was not citizenship that happened.
I could put them in a similar situation that they already were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working inside the system for their release and trusted where he was going to <unk>
As soon as I waited to get home to feel my heart heart.
And in the Himalayas, I found kids carrying kids with stones for miles away from <unk> to trucks that were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than kids than the load and the children were taking their heads on their heads with <unk> <unk> and ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been this whole life.
They have nothing with <unk>
When these <unk> <unk> their freedom, the <unk> completely <unk>
When we hear the word slavery we often think of sexual trafficking, and because of this global awareness to me -- that would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously previously <unk> sex.
It took me out of a few <unk> who gave this <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was more well a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, are local for prostitution prostitution for <unk>
They have small rooms, private rooms, where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of just seven years -- are forced to the clients and they are <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers are often suffering from sexual abuse of their customers.
On the <unk> I remember having sense of a <unk> <unk> <unk> and, in that instant, I could barely imagine what it should be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> and the stairs where they <unk>
There were no <unk> doors.
There were no big windows like it for <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, since you touch a theme that is important to point out that slavery, even sexual trafficking, is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people in the agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can move on.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sex <unk>
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to labor <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were Indian families made in the trade of silk.
This is a family.
<unk> black hands are the father, the blue and red, from their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My translator told me their stories.
"We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope yet, can be able to get out of this house someday and go to another place where we actually pay us our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 <unk> children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went through a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a fishermen in a boat, two older brothers, some younger children -- some more young children -- it makes sense, right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
Children are separated from their native families who have been forced to work <unk> in these boats on the lake, despite not knowing swim.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> that his small canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by fear of falling into water.
The branches of the trees plunged into Lake <unk> often to catch networks and children, <unk> and with fear, they dropped the branches.
Many of them are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
The fear of his love is not going to run out and like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> tries to slave slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they were raising the last networks, but they had been working from the one in the end.
<unk> and <unk>
And it will be able to point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter where the <unk> <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who got to be because of someone who decided to make the difference in their life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with partners from <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> who was suddenly sped up and <unk> our car and played the window.
We asked us to take it through a land path to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we were going to help us out of the car, and he asked the driver to go very quickly.
And then he pointed out this path just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the <unk> path.
As we started to go down, we take away the <unk> that <unk> the road and after walking around an hour -- we found that the way was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of photos on my head as they put together in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> the way I ended up <unk> in one of us, and we had a mass of holes in a field of holes that could fit in a football field and they were all full of migrant workers.
A lot of women had children tied up to their back and they were looking for gold, <unk> in hot waters with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well they were <unk> in your own sweat.
I remember I looked at his eyes, tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The pits have to take up to 90 feet and these people carry heavy stone bags that then will be transported to another area where they would get the stone to be able to extract the gold.
To the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if we look closer, we look closer, we see some other lucky ones, and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and diseases and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> will end up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> for <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, he took him to work with him in mines.
By dying their uncle, <unk> <unk> the debt of the uncle is going to be a slave for the mines.
When I met her, I had worked in the mines of 14 years and the injury of the leg that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet that's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he has to be liberated and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and this is this kind of determination, in the face of a remote, which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen for you all over the world.
I wanted you to figure out that we'll give them witness to them and we will do everything we can to help change their lives.
<unk> I think if we can see each other as human beings, then it's really hard to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not magazine -- they're real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I don't think of these many beautiful people, <unk> that I've had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images wake up a force where you see them in people like you, and I hope that that force turns into a fire and that that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I make math mathematics applied and there's a peculiar problem for the people who are <unk> we are like management investigation.
Nobody knows what the hell do we do.
So today, I was trying to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We get rid of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> dancers --  that we'll see later on.
But the <unk> demand a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of dexterity and probably some <unk> <unk> that can be a genetic component.
Sadly, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease, destroy this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time was a virtuous ballet dancer who was a ballet ballet dancer in his time.
In the last few years, it's made a lot of progress in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it is too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we will know if there really exists an objective cure when we have an objective metric and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement is not biological <unk> so they don't make blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological exam for 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside of the clinical trials, they never do.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the exam for ourselves?
You don't need to be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the clinic <unk>
So what I want to propose to you as a way that we have not conventional to try, you can see, in a sense, at least we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of string <unk>
It shows someone as good as it makes noises to talk to you, we can imagine as dancers of a <unk> <unk> because we have to coordinate all these vocal vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes that are needed -- for example.
And like <unk> requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about the time it takes a child to learn to speak.
From the sound, we can track the position of the vocal cords as they <unk> and as well as Parkinson's affects the <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
In the bottom of the bottom of you can see an example of a irregular shake of the vocal cords of vocal strings.
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> weakness and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of symptoms.
How do you compare these <unk> tests.
The neurological test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
Both of them are <unk> OK, but also the <unk> tests in your voice are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, they take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They're <unk> and we all know what happens to happen.
When something takes a very slippery cost of scale.
These are some amazing goals to <unk>
We can reduce our patients.
I don't want to go to the clinic for the <unk>
<unk> <unk> we could get objective data.
We could do massive <unk> for clinical trials for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So when I will give the first steps today in that sense, we're releasing the Women's <unk> Initiative.
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no disease, it can call low price and leave recordings for a few, and I'm pleased to announce that we've reached 6 percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So let's go back, taking all of these samples of, say, 10,000 people, you can say who is healthy and who doesn't?
What are you going to take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call -- you have to indicate if you have or not the disease. TR: Sure.
<unk> You see, some people can not <unk> you may not get it.
But we're going to get a very big sample of data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the factors of confusion in search of real markers of the disease.
TR: You have an precision <unk> at this point?
It's a lot more than that.
Actually, my graduate student, I have to <unk> it has done a fantastic job, and now it has shown that it works on the mobile phone network too, which is what the project is -- we now have a 99 percent accurately.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are creatures <unk>
We are <unk> in the dark, <unk> rooms and large, we avoid sunlight.
We make these thin models even more <unk> the perfect skin -- still more perfect -- we do the impossible, you can do it in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with a lot of years of experience and a real taste of images and a real taste for the images and the photograph.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Shortly after that, an organization that was <unk> where <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 21, I traveled to <unk>
It's a little fishing town located in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave.
The water level of water recorded over 24 feet and over three miles land inside.
As you can imagine, the people was <unk>
We would see rubble of channels and <unk>
<unk> schools. We took the mud and we leave the lists for <unk> and <unk>
We took tons of <unk> and tons of fish dead, they <unk> out of the local factory.
We <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and pictures of pictures and cameras and <unk> cards.
Everybody did the same thing.
<unk> and take them to different places from the villages around to <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As we were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean the bathrooms and the enormous, gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And so there they carried them, and I had the honor of that day to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, had heard of the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I was going to go beyond my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some that they had over a hundred years some of you were still in the lab about the lab, I couldn't help but think of how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I entered Facebook contacted a few of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive and I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl -- I had a lot of accuracy and <unk>
In other ways, that little girl would not have the aspect of her itself, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
By the time of time, they came up with more pictures, and they needed more pictures, so he went back to Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were <unk> to <unk> a village on the north of <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the American <unk> <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that we were in <unk> is a different story, it depended on the <unk> of the photos.
It could be a time for an hour. I could do a couple of weeks.
I could do a few months.
This <unk> had to draw pretty much by hand using as a guide the areas whose color and detail the water had no destroyed.
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these <unk> pictures in the saltwater, covered in bacteria, with algae, even with the oil -- all of it along with the time I continue to <unk> it was an important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the picture unless it was clean <unk> and it would have been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky at the <unk>
We have the guidance of a <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more photos even <unk>
As once he said, <unk> the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures were lucky in relation to the photos.
He had begun to <unk> she was stopped to realize that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and his own face would not have been <unk> we were able to put up the images in a single picture, and you get the full picture.
When they collected their pictures shared something from his story with us.
A few colleagues of her husband found the pictures in a department station between the rubble station in the rubble of where he used to be his house, but his colleagues would get it.
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside of the water as the <unk> <unk>
Your small children, not so small now, but their two children were in school in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
It took a week to find his family and know that everybody had survived.
The day I gave her his pictures his younger son to be 14 years old.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could <unk> something that he could go back to look, something that I could remember from the past day that I would not have been marked on March from March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan volunteers had joined up to <unk> hundreds of them were helped us clean up to <unk> <unk> photographs -- the great <unk> -- the vast majority came back in their own <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us bring back to 90 percent of a whole bunch of <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend more than 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of somebody or something, one place, a relationship, somebody loved it.
They're <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing we would wear but the first thing that we want to look for.
And this is what the project was to restore small pieces of humanity, to return to someone its connection to the past.
When a picture like this comes back to somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person that receives it.
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected to something bigger -- to bring something bigger -- using their talent to something that aren't thin models of perfect skin.
To finish this email. I sent him Cindy the day I came back from Japan after six months.
While <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One particular in particular, a photo with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathering around a baby, I was <unk> because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, me and my <unk> daughter hangs out of our wall.
In the whole world, in all of our basic needs, right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet crossing an apple in an exhibition in a <unk> of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go for a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technique that can create videos on the slow motion of the light movement.
And with that we can create cameras that you can see after <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and challenging the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and turn it into a second or a second or a second -- you can create a bunch of photons just a millimeter wide millimeter apart.
And this <unk> package that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a common bullet does.
If we took that bullet and this package of photons and fire in this bottle, how do you disperse those photons into this <unk>
What is the light aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all of this --   remember, all this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light on motion.
Coca-Cola doesn't take this research --  -- so many things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> enters the bottle with a package of photons that starts to <unk> and that inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light is going to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble bubble that's bounces inside the inside.
At that time, the waves travel through the table and due to the reflections of the top of the bottle, you see in the bottom of the bottle, the <unk> of the <unk> that the insights are <unk>
Now, if we take a common and current bullet and we make it go the same distance and we see it in slow down to about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to see that film?
A day? A week? Actually a whole year.
It would be a very boring movie --  of a slow bullet movement.
And how about testing it with <unk>
You can see the waves coming from the table, the tomato table, and the bottom wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought of a <unk> at once, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look at more and more this <unk> you'll realize that, as the light gets rid of the <unk> <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces inside it and comes back from several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your phone, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to touch it.
Why do we create this camera at MIT? India?
Like photographers, you know, if we take a picture at the lower exposure, it goes very little light away.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the shortest exposure than the shortest exposure -- so I could just get some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those <unk> data and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in raw and <unk>
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, they can become invisible, too.
And if a new power of a future I would let you see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You will go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera, and from there to the camera.
where we could extract those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We've already built.
On the left is our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will come back to the camera but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works like this, our <unk> has unique capacities for us.
It's got very good temporal resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also to the hidden objects but we don't know what point corresponds to what it is distance.
When you project a laser in <unk> you can record a photo, you see on the screen, it really doesn't make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, and we will take a lot of images like this, and we are going to be able to look at the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we'll be able to see the <unk> object.
We'll be able to see it inside.
This is our reconstruction.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are <unk> collisions with what's on the back of the curve, around.
Or we could find survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at the light reflected through the open windows.
Or could we build <unk> able to see the inside of the body through <unk> and the same thing for <unk>
But, of course, because of the tissue and the blood -- this is quite hard, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new operating mode in order to solve the problems of mammography to the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, became science in art, a art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> of data that we collect every time are not just for scientific visualizations but we can see that we can see that we can be able to scientific visualizations
And we create a new form of video photography, with slow and gene code.
And look at those waves remember, the time between each of those waves is just about <unk> of a second.
But this is also a lot of fun.
If we look at the waves under the <unk> these are leaving us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects, and Einstein would have loved to see this picture.
The order where the events are happening in the world sometimes you get invested in the camera.
It <unk> the corresponding <unk> of space and time, we can fix this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> life, and gives you individual freedom out.
With a cell phone, it can be a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a cell phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone, you can record a song, moving it to <unk> and get famous.
This is all possible with a mobile.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to this one.
Here you can see the hundreds of thousands of people who are looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathered in search for a change, had a cell phone in our pocket.
Who are having a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone.
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot. Almost everybody today has a mobile.
But today I'm talking about me, from my mobile, and how I changed life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission of the E.U. presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk> of <unk>
This directive says that every European telephone company, every single service provider has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls who. Who sends an email to who.
Who sends a text to whom.
And if we use your mobile phone, where we are.
All this information is stored for at least six months, and until two years, in your phone company or its Internet provider or the Internet.
And all around Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone phone and the Internet providers -- all of this information about us.
There were lawyers, priests, priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of East Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use the <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> that at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, which please get rid of all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to wonder, and I didn't get a concrete answer, it was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
And so I decided to make a demand for judicial because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we'll not give this information.
At the end of it. I mean, you know.
<unk> the demand and they will send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly on brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> 30 lines of information.
And I saw them and I said, well, it's a huge file. Okay.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
Was it a little bit <unk> what should do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where step night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the data retention means.
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open it does this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom in and go back and forward.
You can see every step I give you.
And you can see how I'm going to go from the train to <unk> and how often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives you a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
But all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, and we talk a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then you call the other, and the other one to the other, and we end up with this big communication network.
You can see how their people communicate with each other to what time they call each other, what time they do to sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who's talking to who, who is sending an email to whom, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and until two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in our pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall -- maybe I'd never happened.
And as a result, neither is the fall of <unk>
Because today, the state agencies and companies want to store as much information of us as possible inside and out of the web.
They want to have the possibility of following our lives and they want to support our lives forever.
But the <unk> and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for information.
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to your friends with your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and it's not just fashion.
When you go home, you get to their representative that just because business and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what are you working from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones that will give you to remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hi unpredictable. What happens?
It's not enough.
Hi unpredictable. What happens?
I call me <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me into the world.
<unk> to my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, and that's why you get all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. C.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one -- the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were cousins, siblings, although they are.
It's just about accidents, like the one that I was at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration -- and I don't want any of you to be there.
It feels bad for me, because at some point of life, you wish to be a disabled
Let's go for a walk.
<unk> <unk> are at the shopping mall, drive in circles looking for parking lot and what do you see?
16 empty places for a disabled.
And they think, "God, can I be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I say, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. It's just one of them.
There was a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a Palestinian <unk> Muslim woman, and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease had the same thought.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I would.
A lot of people with cerebral <unk> <unk> but my parents don't believe in <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters <unk> me <unk>
If my three older sisters were going to the public school, my parents would go to the school system, and they were <unk> that I was as well. And if I didn't get all the ultimate note -- all of my mother.
My father taught me to walk at the age of five by putting my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another tactic that I used was to hang on a dollar in front of me so that we would get it.
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong and ...
Yes. The first day in kindergarten was walking as a <unk> champion who had received many <unk>
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 <unk> and they're still all of the family.  I think nobody realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> as a campaign.
People who grew up had no trouble with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of <unk> a lot of hunger in the <unk>
I told you that he had enough fat to live three months without eating it, so <unk> at dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and I want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk> I was as well.
And when my friends were friends, they went on the summer holiday on the coast of Jersey, I was not going.
I spent my summers on a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we weren't going back to Palestine all the <unk> we would get to <unk>
On the summer holiday I often find my father tried to <unk> so I was drinking milk on his back, so I were drinking hot cups on his back, I would remember the water <unk> and I remember the water <unk> and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I should say it's very boring, but before I do yoga was a comedian of <unk> that I could not stand up <unk> <unk>
And now I can put it on the head.
My parents gave up this idea that I could do anything, that any dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through the positive discrimination and I got a scholarship to <unk> University of the State of Arizona, because I walked in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> <unk> of the theater.
All of me.
I did all the same tasks of the least smart, I took the ultimate note in my classroom, and also in his classes.
Every time I did a scene of the glass zoo my teachers <unk>
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a work called <unk> very slow in <unk>
It's a work of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk>
I've got <unk>
By the end of it, you know, finally <unk>
Thank God <unk> I finally am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the director of the theater department, crying -- historically, as if somebody had killed my cat, ask why and she told me that they could not do the stunt stunt at all.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do any stunts at risk, you can't do the <unk>
It was a role that he literally had been born and gave him to an actress without cerebral <unk>
college was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors who have no disability for disabled
When I graduated, I came back home, and my first tour tour, was like extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there like a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with disabilities.
You just hate perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
On my first tour of New York City in New York City to New Jersey, and never forget the face of the first poem that he took when he was at the realization that I was at high speed by the New Jersey highway with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs around the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I am the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little disgusting rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find us very fun.
In 2003, my brother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the Festival of the <unk> <unk> in New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and eventually remind the directors of <unk> that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> Arabs were much easier to fight the challenge of the stigma of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news program by cable news -- it has Keith <unk>
I went out as if I was to graduate school, I went back to a study and sat me in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I held on to the desktop desk to not get driving on the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew they wouldn't come back to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but he was like I had a complete time and pasted my chair.
One fun thing that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that kids are <unk> but they never become <unk> of me no longer than a girl or older.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
And I would see clips online, like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk>
What disease does it?
We should really be praying for it.
A <unk> suggested even I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as the race.
If someone in the wheelchair can't make <unk> then you can't make someone in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors say I don't know, but I'm here in front of you.
However, having grown up with media, I don't think <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images that would make less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
We may even need all of the society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has taken me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I got to act in a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world, Arabs have become <unk>
I was <unk> in a depiction of the great state of New Jersey in <unk> 2008.
And I founded <unk> a charity charity to give the children refugee children, a tiny fraction of what my parents would get.
It was the only time my father saw me live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call me <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child from a small town.
I don't know their name, but I know his story.
She lives in a small town to South <unk>
This people are near <unk>
<unk> drives the small people to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
No for him there, it's going to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunities, there is no job, no idea of future.
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day is a day about a man who offers him to <unk> after dinner, to <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
He gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send it home, your family.
They present to a young man.
Eventually, it home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky <unk> a bomb.
That kid in that small village with dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist -- and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> a terrorist organization with al Qaeda.
So how do the story of a little boy in a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start their future, expecting a perspective perspective, and this was the first thing that it arrived.
This was the first thing that he took him from what we call the <unk>
And their story repeats in urban centers around the world.
It's the history of the <unk> young urban <unk> that <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For young people, the promise of town, the great dream of the city is the opportunity for jobs, for well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who suffer from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people living in cities are being under age under 18 years.
If we don't include the young people in the growth of our cities, if we don't give them opportunities for the history of <unk> to <unk> the door of access to terrorism, violence, violence, to be the story of cities 2.0.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, not going to school.
They don't do pretty much at all.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the Hospital in the hospital where I was born.
I remember going to be in front of that hospital <unk> thinking, and if I never had gone?
And if I had been forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor some youth leaders on a business peak.
<unk> to a few young Islamic leaders <unk>
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no work, no opportunity.
And I remember when he was a graduate graduate college because he was a graduate white college for Al <unk> and other organizations -- terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to reach from point A to B are the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and the <unk>
He started a company of <unk>
She started <unk> and tied up to local residents who normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of bikes for the next three years.
Why is this different story?
What makes this story different?
I think the ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I believe that environmental spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that they're looking for so much.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the height of corporate initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business entrepreneurship.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen over 22 years, and until recently, until she wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic sent from the overseas.
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer is: <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a company of <unk> and <unk> design.
I created a farm outside of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive the hard climate <unk>
And he started the delivery of flowers to wedding by creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies and now is working in the creation of the world's first public park in <unk> at 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where the young families, they can go together, and as he says, smell the <unk> <unk>
By the way, he's not growing pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought to work for an NGO, working for the government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
The encouraged to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, to inspire young people and create a culture of business spirit -- is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and orientation to protect them in development and put their businesses.
They need young people with the resources that they need to do -- they need support that they need to move from conception to creation, and will create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, entrepreneurship is something else to start a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His Park <unk> This is how it calls it when it is created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired kids on the street to help rent and keep the bikes for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape from paralysis of the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs who are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to make young people on entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their innovation <unk> and they will have more stories about the flowers and the Parks of the Peace that <unk> and <unk>
Thank you.
I was about ten years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> mountains, an area <unk> north of the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest.
The sun made the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and it's not going to be on the path that we could almost pretend that we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We arrived at our camp.
It was a shed on a <unk> <unk> <unk> when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four square feet with apple hearts with apple hearts -- aluminum <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
<unk> who were too lazy to pull out what they thought they were going to clean up their <unk>
And that question kept with me, and he would get a little bit <unk>
Who clean.
No matter how it <unk> or where do we <unk> <unk> who cleans our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our trash -- for 11 tons of waste and two thousand tons of recyclable products, every day.
I wanted to know that as individuals.
I wanted to understand who that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled on the trucks and walked through his pathways, and I interviewed people in office and facility in the entire city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to make more.
So I started working as a trash <unk>
Now not just I was traveling on the trucks. I got the <unk>
And they <unk> the mechanical mechanics and bar.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe it, and in the days that it's very strong one is going to be <unk> quickly.
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies were still <unk> to the weight of taking on their body tons of garbage all the weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Office of FBI <unk> the gathering of waste is one of the 10 <unk> more dangerous people in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and entering the entire day and pass all around you.
They just want to <unk> so the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And also the garbage itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the relentless of garbage.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the trash is as a force of nature itself.
It never stops coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It always has to be in motion.
And the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is particularly ironic because I believe strongly that the <unk> hand is the most important workforce in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the earliest <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste of waste and effective and effective every day, this starts to <unk> their <unk> and their dangers inherent us in very real ways.
<unk> we had controlled for decades and centuries come back to <unk> and they start <unk>
The economy needs them.
If we can't get rid of the old thing we don't have room for what the drivers of the economy begin to fail when it's in danger of the consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just pointing out its relationship.
And then it's what I call our average average speed necessary.
I mean by the way that I mean by the speed at the time we used to move in the contemporary time.
We are usually not <unk> or <unk> and we carry on with us our cup of coffee, our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use them, we forget them, we forgot about them, because we know that there's a job force on the other side that will take about it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about the collection of waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable city and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day in a <unk> way.
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when you <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that keeps us safe from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow has always to stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11th, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste truck on the street, grabbed my son little and I went down the stairs and I went down the stairs and I got a man doing his journey of recycled paper as I did all <unk>
And I tried to thank him for doing his work that particular day, but I began to cry.
And he looked at me and just said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be OK."
Shortly after that, I started to research the collection of waste, and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we work together so many times and we did good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we should have to include all the costs -- even the very real human cost of the labor labor.
The city waste is what we think when we talk about trash, represent three percent of the waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable <unk>
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next thing that you see someone whose job is to clean out the garbage -- <unk> a moment for <unk>
I was a moment to tell you a moment to tell you.
My work is focused on the connection of thinking about our community life, forming the environment of the environment where architecture is born naturally in the conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects as an example of this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that the different analysis of different perspectives become an essential part of the final piece of architecture.
The first example began with an invitation to design a shopping center in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, to my team and me about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores in which people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to use a lot of energy because the coating of the <unk> makes heat into the interior, so it is necessary so much.
In a city in which this should not happen because it is a climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees across the whole year.
And thirdly, what it looks like has nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a pity for being so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, he was really <unk> with the old market, which is this structure in the open air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a building, of various stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the <unk> the site, which is located in an area of a lot of growth in the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image, didn't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of a hundred meters.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, assembling all the entries in the building.
And it spreads by an <unk> <unk> that creates a space to the open air in the building that would be absorbed by its own shape, and the sun and rain.
And around this space we have applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that will lead to local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar fabric of a concrete loop with <unk> to allow the air input to the air, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the dresses of <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little crystals of colors that use light from the inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas that did not be easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a shopping center -- it wasn't what they did.
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market was to be much more profitable than the commercial center because there were more local to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was so much more economic -- not just because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it was no longer necessary to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to get the power <unk> for the building in a city where electricity takes almost every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting on the roof.
And then under those panels we think on the roof like a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this urban oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, and they collect water for the edge.
It was expected for the principles of next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a <unk> plan and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a project so big, the biggest thing I have designed, I needed not just to understand the city of Tunisia, but also their environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis I put very carefully attention to <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a dozen <unk> doors of access to <unk> on the straight lines.
When I went to place, the first design operation that we did was extend the streets and also creating 12 initial blocks in size and features in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some points in relation to the idea of <unk> doors with straight lines, and this altered the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the small cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation.
So let's make a scheme that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then on the lower plant, we have all the connections for the pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that they set up a higher density at the upper levels and a higher density on the ground floor.
And it also reinforces this idea of doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving up the community that space is occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors can go up and drive it up and do activities like run a race for two miles in the morning, or jump from one building to the other.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities that are literally growing up.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes communities and economies at the same rate of pace the buildings grow up.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but we need to improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have as a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had great hair very bright hair and a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of nice <unk> so it was super strong for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
And I ended up that year and I was full of <unk> until I had my sinister plan.
One day I got a time after the <unk> I was a bit late and I hid in the bathroom of girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took off the table of my teacher <unk>
And then I did.
I would check out the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just a few percent.
All the rest.  And I signed up to return the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my peers had really good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of these rows out of <unk> and I was just a row out of it, just by being there, because he <unk>
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I was doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I was never <unk>
It's that it was all <unk>
I will never tell me.
But most of all, I was telling me the reason that I was bothered by this little bit so small, it was so good for <unk>
I love jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also, the primates. The birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of <unk> in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that analyze the loneliness, or the long duration of the sadness.
And so you have to go to the fiction, because the novels are like the lab in which they are studying them in all their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there were no <unk> she would have no literature.
Well, there would be no <unk> and it wouldn't have <unk>
There would be no king <unk> and <unk>
It wouldn't have Shakespeare.
I was going to show you the reading lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> there would be no <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
No <unk> no <unk> I know that <unk> has the answers to everything, and in terms of <unk> almost that they have all of them.
This year was 100 years of his work -- <unk> <unk> for the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the <unk> <unk> -- my own, all you might have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think of a child trying to get out of sleep.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forgot about how relentless it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk>
I don't know how it is <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious like the <unk> that you get to the person, to their wish, are a very good narrative <unk>
I don't know. I think we get very close to bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
A story about life of other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being <unk> and audience, we know exactly what the details were going to do to nail the knife, right?
The <unk> do all novelists <unk> and that's something that <unk> understand.
Everything that she does for me to give me pleasure I could do to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh <unk> that <unk> it in his lover -- he adds up to his collection of torture of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion <unk> You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> get rid of the information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like the great amounts of bright hair, and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> came out of the photos.
That's why Instagram it's so successful --  -- <unk> links well <unk> language with the jealousy.
When <unk> is in your wedding <unk> suddenly listening behind the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then they rank those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you know that this is <unk> but it's not different than the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "They're scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem like <unk> but in their <unk> they're pursuit of knowledge, search of the truth, a really painful truth, in fact, to what it is, <unk> the more agonizing the best.
The pain, the <unk> -- these were the pathways to the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs to, that makes us all, causes us to make a lot more profound and much deeper and vital feelings that a wise man who can tell us.
It's telling us that we're going to go and look for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> give us ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular way.
Is there any other emotion we have -- our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at the intensity so <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a young young woman who was being consumed with the idea that his woman was <unk>
And Freud said that there was something weird in that man, which he didn't bother what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under <unk> without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he was doing his wife, without realizing that.
<unk> <unk> or just accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
The novels are really good at this.
The novels describe very well how the <unk> make us look at the intensity and <unk>
In fact, the most intensely <unk> we are, more we become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, the <unk> are taking us to make violent or illegal acts of it.
<unk> drive us to behave in a whole way.
Now I'm thinking about me at the age of eight years, I think, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman of Michigan from 52 old age was captured by having created a false account on Facebook from which they were sent to <unk> messages to itself, for a year.
For one year. A year.
She was trying to meet the new girlfriend of his former boyfriend, I have to confess that when I was doing this, I was going to be able to admiration at her.
Because, let's be realistic.
What huge even though <unk> creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel of Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> who are trying to figure out how to <unk> our minds, and once we're in the sphere, in the realm of <unk> the membrane that separates what could be, can be <unk> in a second.
Let's take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want what you have to take out of your self and show you what you once <unk> and it's under the floor. <unk> your name, takes your <unk> cow <unk>
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the path of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> all over the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social networks, where the currency is <unk> right?
The novels show us the <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to <unk> <unk> Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think of <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always had a lot of brilliant <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the genius of <unk> but it bothers him.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but you get it <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each of the mysteries.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the <unk> <unk> once you <unk> inside, you get to all of your solution, <unk> it goes back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We are proud of <unk>
And he tells you that there is no person in <unk> <unk> who wouldn't want to leave your hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> transferred in history. I think it looks very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry, no excitement.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute they're on the same side.
Suddenly, <unk> is allowed to admire that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be so easy?
What happens if the <unk> are really a geometry, just a matter of where we allow us to be in relation to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to <unk> the excellence of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So while we hope that that happens, we remember that we have the fiction to <unk>
Only fiction, <unk> jealousy.
The fiction used the <unk> he invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> sweet <unk> the scary terrifying -- Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
The 21 of July of 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped outside the module by Apollo 11 and landed on the Beaufort Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but his presence in the upper gray surface, was the culmination of a collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest exploration of peace in American history.
To get to the moon, NASA was spending about 180 billion dollars a day, or four percent of the federal budget today.
Apollo gave work to about 400,000 people and asked for 20,000 companies, universities and universities and government agencies.
They were killed, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program started, 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> <unk> on his surface of which Aldrin issued after death of Armstrong last year, is the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that the 24 of the <unk> later, a new sense of the <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that the president Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the French words at Rice University in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some people ask yourselves why <unk>
Why do it turn it into our goal?
And you could also ask, why could the mountain scale <unk>
Thirty-five years ago, why fly on the <unk>
Why plays Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the Moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> Apollo was not just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
In the time, the stronger emotion was the wonder of amazed at terms of the powers of the technology.
It was because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of <unk> technology.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, they were <unk> <unk> and eliminated smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what was Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship with candle -- but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10 flew to 40,000 miles per hour.
Since 1970, no human being turned to the moon.
Nobody has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the joyful surprise about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that problems that we imagined technology would solve how to go to Mars, create a clean energy, to cure cancer, or feed the world population seem to be <unk>
I remember seeing the Apollo aircraft <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that we don't go to the escape <unk> of the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure that I could see the colonies on Mars.
So that's how it happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard about the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologists would have <unk> us, and they had enriched toys with trivial, things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that are accelerating <unk>
There's nothing wrong about most of these things.
They have expanded and enriched our lives.
But not the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation for the Silicon Valley, which is that <unk> that have created less ambitious companies than <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Microsoft, and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, in particular, the incentives that the venture capitalists offer to entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused the creation of <unk> ideas for the funding of <unk> problems, or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly goes wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their high point without worrying about the risk, they preferred small investments, the minute they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble investing in technologies like energy, which need a huge amount of capital, and that development is in the long term. They haven't yet invested in the development of technologies intended to solve big problems because they don't have a commercial value.
No, the reasons we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we choose to not solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if we get to <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular and that will never happen.
We won't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things than to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because the political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption comes from energy sources like solar solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely economic economic point.
<unk> and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want alternative energy sources that can compete at the price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and international treaties -- development of <unk> energy, a significant increase in the research and development of energy, and some kind of control of the price of coal.
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we'll see an energy policy of the U.S. or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that they seemed technological, it turns out not to be.
We know for a long time that famines are a result of failure in the <unk>
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affect <unk> the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like harvest or systems for storage and <unk> but there will be something like there was bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon told the war to cancer in 1971, but we soon discovered that there are a lot of cancer, some terribly resistant cancer, and only in the last 10 years they seem to have been found effective and effective viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve the problems with technology.
We can and we have -- but these four elements have to be <unk> The political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem: institutions need to support the <unk> it should be really about a <unk> problem, and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it is true with those <unk>
But it's a model that is in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like the Cold War, there's no politician like John Kennedy and <unk> difficult and dangerous, and there is no popular mythology of science fiction like exploring the solar system.
In general, going to the Moon it turned out to be simple.
It was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with the <unk> ideas that have about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a great decline of trust, it's a very general belief in the world.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third one is a <unk> we should recover trust.
I think the goal -- the goal and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives you a more clear idea about that.
First, why people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
It will turn me to think that it can have been <unk> in some activities or institutions, and that could be augmented in others.
I don't have the clear.
But I can turn to the opinion surveys, and opinion polls are supposed to be the source of the belief that trust has gone down.
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there are no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, keep the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago are still quite <unk> as nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway on.
But this is this evidence for enough?
What the opinion polls are, of course, opinion.
What else can you get?
What you see is the generic attitudes that people feel when they do certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody will say to you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in <unk> teachers.
You probably ask for asking, "What do you do?
And that would be a very compelling response.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust you, but in other not."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust as a <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel for a certain kind of official officer or kind of person, is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, I have to say I trust a certain elementary school teacher I know to give the class, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but not, maybe, to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all that knowledge when we think of trust in the most <unk>
I think the surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they try to engage the good criminal <unk> in fact, to trust something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more confidence.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It's not that the goal I <unk>
I will encourage you to have more confidence in what it is about trust, but not what it isn't.
In short, I'm <unk> not to trust what is not reliable.
And I think that those people who were trying their savings with the very unusual point called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, it says, yes, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What is about doing a judgment about how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that we can do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that one person is <unk> in the <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we will have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they are not accountable, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that we will be able to get their own <unk>
And I'm very happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible and extremely <unk>
If this is that, I still haven't <unk>
But that's what we're going to have to do before you trust.
The trust is the answer.
I'm going to get to you what we need to <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've tried to build systems and accountability for all sorts of institutions, professional officials and so forth, who made us easier the task to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as <unk>
I remember one time I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you know, <unk> the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> going to <unk>
And we find the same problem in all of our public life, and we need to focus that the accountability system that is meant to guarantee the <unk> and the evidence of <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You must all know some similar examples.
They were going to take it all that, for the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we have to be worthy of being worthy of trust and <unk> people who are reliable and if we need to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions -- the <unk> which doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to rebuild the trust, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should reconstruct trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
Can we reconstruct a little bit trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But the confidence in short, is <unk> because they give us other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations for enough to be able to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't afford it by all people, all the time.
But you also have to be able to make sure that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That gets every day, everywhere, the common people, the <unk> the institutions, the institutions, very well.
Let me give you a simple example.
The shop where I buy my socks to say I can drive them back without giving them <unk>
And I take them back and return me the money, or they change the color of the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson on that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have trust what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think what we're pointing to is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
Since the early computers we have come up with <unk> by reducing the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen in which the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been increasingly becoming increasingly and more and more, to such a point that is less than one millimeter, the thickness of the glass display, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I wouldn't have <unk>
So I started to imagine how to <unk>
First of all, I created this tool that is embedded in the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers to its physical body to <unk>
And designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool, the barriers.
But the two hands still outside the screen.
How can you get inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity of the hands?
In the <unk> division of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
And then you get a transparent bombsight with camera cameras to detect the fingers and the face, you can now lift the hands of the keyboard, get inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like windows and archives have a location in real space, <unk> is as easy as taking a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and highlight lines or talk to the virtual <unk> sensor that are down there in every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come towards us?
<unk> many of us will have bought and interesting things by the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make them be physicists so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would it be like that?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor visiting <unk> and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical pixel alone.
This <unk> magnet, behave like a 3D pixel in space, which means that the computer as users can move the object anywhere in this small three-dimensional space.
So what we did was we <unk> the gravity and controlling the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
And by programming the object, the object, we released it from the restrictions of time and space, which means human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and remain in the physical world.
You can start teaching them physically and distance and famous takes from Michael Jordan, you can reproduce as a physical reality the times that we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and, unlike the monitors or the textbooks. This is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what is more fascinating to change the computer physics is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show you something but to begin to act directly on us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without us to have our world <unk>
We started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you hit that barrier, the only frontier that is left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1950s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to go to a school for athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After we survive the Islamic Revolution -- create strongly that there was just a <unk> path to <unk> a safe and good job.
No matter whether the work I'd like or not.
But my dream was to be an opera singer Chinese opera.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer has to start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the speaker of a radio show.
But no adult would give you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends were <unk> but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream is never <unk>
<unk> that for the rest of my life a second class of second class was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one to me wanted to <unk> OK.
I went to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in 1995, and what were the first books that I did here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> deals with Chinese <unk>
And it's not propaganda for <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's one issue for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I said. It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to go out of this <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
And I find it with a new culture also led to my <unk> habit.
Let's get a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning of this map I thought out of place, because this is what the students in China learn.
I had never occurred, that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
Public reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to research fields like religion and comparative literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked for research, why don't we do it in everyday life?
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
By <unk> <unk> are economic and spiritual and spiritual <unk>
By Buddha, they are all <unk> genuine fear and duty -- Interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> Alan <unk> Instead of dying in the translation, found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to go back to feel like or powerless ever.
Having a <unk> dream is really nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect to the place that the dreams, where the dreams, is where the passion comes from.
A <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client from <unk>
I was a PhD student in clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman called Alex.
Alex came up to the first session with jeans and a <unk> bus <unk> dropped off on my office sofa pulled out the shoes and told me I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as a first client.
And I got a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the sessions, and made me easy for just to move my head while I would bring the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> he said, Alex, and what I looked like, she was right.
You start to work after that, she goes home after, he has kids later, until death happens later.
It was like Alex and I had time to eat.
But soon after, my <unk> <unk> led me to push what I would talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Yes, it's coming out with guys under his category, he would be <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like he was to marry him."
And then my <unk> <unk> said, "It's still not, but maybe you get stuck with the next.
In addition, the best time to work in marriage of Alex is before it was <unk>
This is what psychologists call a moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> aren't the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they were doing, but this didn't have the <unk> of Alex to be a pause in their development.
This made me from Alex <unk> to be the perfect moment, and we were <unk>
So I realized, that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences -- not only for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, the families and the future of <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think that nobody gets to age when they didn't go before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk>
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If they work with <unk> they love a <unk> they take a <unk> I want to see. It's fine. It's good.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen to 35 years.
That means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments that shape their life will have gone to when you have 30 and <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or are coming out with their own future couple of years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in their <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there is something they want to change themselves, now is the moment to change it.
We know that personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time of life, and we know that the female fertility goes to its endgame to the 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the moment to <unk> about their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which your everyday life and common life has an impact on the person who was <unk>
But what we don't hear often is that there is something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of adulthood.
The researchers call the <unk> a extended <unk>
The journalists called the <unk> names like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines adulthood.
Leonard <unk> said that to make great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it true?
What do you think happens when you give you a <unk> in your head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and it doesn't happen absolutely nothing.
And then every day every day, smart, smart, interesting ones like you or your kids come to my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship is not -- I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "All say that while starting a career before the 30, everything will be OK."
But then he starts going to sound like this: "My <unk> are by <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better draw the day I graduated from <unk>
And then he starts going to sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like playing chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point around the 30, he turned the music up, and they all began to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only thing to be standing, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the ones here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit, but you don't get the risks very high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there is a huge pressure to the 30 and so many of starting a career, choose a city, and have two or three children in a much more short period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there is research that start to show, which is much harder and stressful to do everything from once to the <unk>
The middle-aged crisis is not about buying red cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
Notice that you can't have the son you want right now, or you can't give your son's son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about his <unk> "What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here is a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
By 25, Emma <unk> came to my office because it was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said he would like to work in art or entertainment, but I could still not decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living some very difficult <unk> his previous life had been even harder.
They were often in our sessions, but then she would raise herself to say, "You don't choose your family, but he can choose your friends."
Well, one day, Emma got her head on his legs and cried for almost the entire hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent the whole morning <unk> with his lots and a lot of <unk> but then he was looking at the empty space that follows after the words said, "In case I call <unk> please call <unk>
I was about to the <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have an accident.
Who is going to take care of me if I am <unk>
At that time, I had a lot of work to resist and not say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that really was <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was a chance.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit while the <unk> <unk> <unk>
So, for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma that the identity crisis, and identity capital of identity.
For identity, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and no one knows the future of work, but I do know this: identity capital generates capital capital.
So now it's the time for that work on the other side of the country, from that <unk> of that company that you want to try it.
I'm not going to <unk> <unk> I'm going to <unk> the exploration that should not tell -- which, by the way, is not exploration, which, by the way, is not exploration, which, by the way, is not exploration.
It's <unk>
I told Emma to explore jobs and make them count.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the ones that get together with friends with similar minds are limited to who you know who you know, what you know about, how to think about it, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person to get out of almost always comes from outside of its closest circle.
The new things come from what they're called <unk> <unk> friends from their friends.
Yes, half of them have a bad job or don't have a job.
But the other half not, and the weak ties are the way we put it into this group.
Half of the jobs created never <unk> then, knowing the chief of your neighbor is how to get a job not published yet.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
For last but not least, Emma believed you don't choose your family, but I know his friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> Emma soon went to her family, when she has a partner and we form her own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had arrived.
Maybe you think that 30 is better to sit in mind than 20 or even 25 or I agree with you.
But choose the person you live in now or <unk> you now when all on Facebook are starting to walk towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before we did, and that involves being as intentional in love as you're in the work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just making it work or kill time with anyone who is giving them to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate in a room who was working in an art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped him get a job there.
That work supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend with the <unk>
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special of events in museums.
This married man who chose <unk>
He was going to love his new career, he loves her new family, and I send me a letter that said, "Now the spaces of contacts are not good enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are as planes coming out from the airport from Los Angeles, to come up somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight match in its trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or 25 or even the <unk> a good break, a good break, a good break, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years or even on the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading all the things that you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to tell Alex.
This is what I now have the privilege of saying to <unk> like Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get the identity capital -- use your weak ties.
Don't be defined by what they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very tough job on management management for a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics to <unk> <unk> in public schools in New York.
And as any teacher, I applied tests and testing.
I just give them tasks.
When the work comes back, we will go grades.
What struck me was that creativity was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the people who had a better performance didn't have scores of I.Q. <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not doing so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in math in seventh grade, safe, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for time enough.
After several years more of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure better ways.
It's the <unk> but what happens if you're successful in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classroom and went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> scenarios. And in every study my question was, who is successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk>
And we tried to predict what would we have to predict in military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what kids were going to do as far as possible in competition.
We studied <unk> teachers working in really difficult neighborhoods -- what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and <unk> who will be the most effective to improve the results of their <unk>
We partnered with private companies, asking yourself, what about these marketers are going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts. It emerged a feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and not <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is a passion and <unk> to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is having a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to your future, day after day, not just a week, not just for the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a race at all speed.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in the public schools.
I asked thousands of high school students who made my questionnaires of determination and then waited for more than a year to see those who are <unk>
It turns out that the children with more determination had significantly more likely to <unk> even when they were putting them in every trait that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the evidence -- even the security results that they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National <unk> of <unk> where <unk> matters is also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
To me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know, how little you know, how little it knows about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you develop the determination in kids?
What do I have to do to teach children a solid job of work?
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The more honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give them <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who are simply not going ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the determination is often not related to or it's even related to <unk>
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing determination in children is something called <unk> from growth."
This is an idea that at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition.
So the mentality of growth is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure whether they have been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to <unk> to start all again with the lessons that are <unk>
In other words, we need to be determined about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as a daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother, the beauty, and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that moment, I was amazed by this incredible language.
But for a abroad, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall <unk>
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that whatever you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learn Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simpler way.
A Chinese academic <unk>
You just need a thousand to understand basic education.
The first 200 of them will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read signs of <unk> menus of <unk> to understand the basic idea of pages or newspapers.
Today I'm going to start with eight to show you how the method.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as possible until it is <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the shape of the fire is a person with arms in both sides as if I were shouting <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> this symbol is actually <unk> of the form of called, but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors of an old West.
I call these eight characters.
They are building blocks so they believe many more characters.
One person.
If you walk back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are company, three are crowd.
If one person stretches their arms, this person is saying <unk> this is this big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a think, like <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree, two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a chart under the tree, we have the foundations.
Put a mouth over the tree, that's a <unk>   -- remember, because a <unk> tree is quite an idiot.
Do you remember <unk>
Two together, it's very hot.
Three together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
One door. Put a chart inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> touched there is somebody at home?
This person is getting hidden from one door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three together, be careful <unk>
So we've already spent almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight <unk> will allow them to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build another 32.
So with every small effort, you will be able to learn a couple hundred <unk> which is the same thing you learn a Chinese for eight years.
So after knowing the <unk> we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is <unk>
This is a sun placed in the beginning because Japan is east of China.
So one sun along the beginning, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked one over the other.
In the old China, that meant <unk> because Chinese <unk> to their political enemies, the beyond the mountains.
Today, the conscience. has become a date.
A mouth that tells you where it comes out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and go from the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the movies I come to see.
I love sharing my favorite movies with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician together.
The film was taken his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a bright dress and bring a magic wand out.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and we raise our children in a kind of an industrial <unk> computer computer program.
However, the magician was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took the rise to the last 40 years later with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> a metal guy and a guy named <unk> <unk> a girl dressed up as an enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the magician of the Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the magician <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like the <unk>
But I think if the magician of Oz will do today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
<unk> shoes to defeat the armies generated by the <unk> <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing from the magician is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I did about Star Wars a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son of a child.
Just three years.
It wasn't invited to projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of oversight had been <unk>  So I was bored in the room and he was impressed as a mom with his foot with his <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was going on, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be the courage of value, <unk> and <unk>
I would say, the sense that Luke was an army to <unk>
I would have this with the magician in <unk>
How does it win Dorothy your movie?
They do good <unk> with everybody and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow to be <unk> right? And not a world of men that <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much energy capital force, force in the movies for our children, and so little on the road of <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know by experience that the princess <unk> it doesn't give me the right framework that would have served me to navigate the world of adults who are <unk>  I think at the time of the first kiss of the first kiss I was actually expected to come up because it is the end of the film, right?
My quest is finished, I have a girlfriend.
Why are they still standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be an animal -- and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk>
There are many exceptions, and to defend the Princess of Disney before any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, even though the kids are not really their target audience.
They do a phenomenal job when we teach girls how to defend the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend their <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have some big women who write new stories for our children, as real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful topic of all time continues to come up in classic <unk> every one of them about the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who are raising a child.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out of <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's available in shops.
Do you remember what the criticism said when it came out of <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that be <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies happens to <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's not actually turning roots and <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book book and the <unk> I recorded a conversation that I had had with a friend of the assessment of the movies you saw.
And it's very simple. There are just three questions that should be <unk> In the movie, there is more than a female character that has <unk>
So, you have to make the requirement.
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something rather than the kid who <unk>   All right?  Thank you.  Thank you.
Two women who exist and they talk about things with each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet, very rarely I see it in the film that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> <unk> <unk> a sense of consensus from what a Hollywood film movie film.
<unk> not the test of <unk>
And I don't think it <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the crisis of the hostage.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have profound conversations and painful and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the <unk> to take a look at the door and say, "Let's go to bed <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go through the numbers.
In 2011, from the most popular movies, how many of them believe they have protagonists of <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's fine.
But there's a bigger number that this is going to take you this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, <unk>
In the United States, one in the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually assaulted in his life.
I don't think it's true of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't think the music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things that I think is there is a lot of sex <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are they <unk>
What do you not achieve <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says the role of a male hero is to defeat <unk> with violence, and then you charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter as those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very disturbing statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our disposal and <unk> <unk> and we hope that we will <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we are educating our children to keep their power out.
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily to parents.
I think we have to show our males a new definition of <unk>
The definition of manhood is radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role that after the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter which was his favorite character for Star Star Wars and you know what he <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What are these two?
Maybe it's not just the bright dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to encourage them to reach their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want fewer stories to say to my <unk> Go and fight only and more stories and more stories where his work looks like to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people better and be better people, like the magician of <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I lived in Maine and one of the things I liked was to look for the sea cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would be luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was going to ask you to <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I can see with my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of almost 1.3 miles of length with the <unk>
And my sea cookies had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to do a map of the past, I knew I had to see a different way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we use the <unk>
This is a place located in the East <unk> of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, in the naked view, it seems to be brown but when we use infrared and we process it using <unk> color, the sudden you see it as a bright pink forest.
What you're seeing are the real chemical changes of the landscape caused by building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find an old American city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Republic about 4,000 years ago.
The place is in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Ottoman Empire. There was this great renaissance of ancient art, architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is massive, it measures roughly <unk> per mile.
Early on, the <unk> <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved into this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
And just as soon as you would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with your eyes, and using baseball gloves.
So, we used NASA data to make a map of place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this area slightly elevated that you see inside the circle here, that we think it could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with inspired scientists doing jobs of <unk> you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of shows in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human occupation for us.
Five meters down, underneath a thick <unk> of mud, we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a <unk> occupation of several hundred years that date from the Middle Empire -- exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found jobs of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> shop and <unk>
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry of the Middle Empire.
So, we have a dense occupation of occupation that dates back the Middle Empire.
We also have evidence of an elite jewelry shop that proves that what I've been there, was a very important city.
We still didn't find any <unk> here, but we will go through the place in a near future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire was probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So according to it, TED was not founded in 1984 by present.
Do we realize that ideas actually started in 1984 <unk> <unk> in a lost city for a lost city and found from the top.
It certainly puts the shells out of shells in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing out in front of the door <unk> home.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the <unk> material that's made.
Now you get a group of <unk> <unk>
They are competing in a racing career.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide against the door of their house.
There are bikes that are flying everywhere, wheels that go on to the side, rays from the wheels that end up in <unk> <unk> <unk> the threshold of the door, <unk>
In the lobby, or whatever you have on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of light. The light shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
They're waving with your hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse speech.
You can feel your blue fur, you can tickle your nose.
You can smell the lawn <unk> and you get about to get into the mouth.
They slept on one side and trained their living room.
In the room, and by using a peak of their imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little clothes, dancing on his middle <unk> singing <unk> One plus <unk> One plus <unk>
Now let's go to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a yellow <unk> road and from the oven come towards you -- the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping up to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition that takes place every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, I suppose, I suppose, that was like the end of a <unk> of <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers and <unk> them just once.
We would take the names of tens and dozens of strangers.
It entire poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize <unk> the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people must be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and has one of the best <unk>
I asked him, "You know, when you realize that you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I am not a wise.
Actually, I have an average memory.
All of those who participate in this competition say they have normal memory.
We said, "We have been trained to perform these miracle acts using these old techniques -- invented two and a half thousand years ago, in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their <unk> and that academics <unk> used to memorize <unk> books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How is I not heard of this <unk>
We were standing outside the hall of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English, although a little bit <unk> he said, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of <unk> live on national TV.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the next year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very likely to be the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a problem of <unk> is awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows you to see how much our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent one afternoon together in the public library of Salt Lake City, <unk> guides was <unk>
And on the back, I read a lot of treaties on writing memory, something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having memory and <unk> and <unk> was not a thing as rare as you can look like today.
A long time ago, people invested in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they have changed.
They have changed the <unk> and I would say that they have changed an cognitive gain.
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people passionate about this idea of <unk> <unk> and <unk> is this as unique memory competition.
It's actually not that <unk> there's a <unk> and this whole world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College in London invited a group of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know: Is it going to be brains in some kind of structural way, or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They're just smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive <unk> and the answer was actually not.
There was a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of the memory champions and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them into an MRI MRI machine, <unk> your brains as they <unk> numbers, and <unk> forms of snow found out that in the memory champions become <unk> parts of the brain, different from others.
In effect, they <unk> or seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> competitive is driving as an armed race in where every year appears to someone with a new way of remembering more things, faster, and then the rest of the competitors should get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
On his desk in front of him, there's 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> that he's about to try to memorize in an hour -- using a technique that he invented and he was just wearing it.
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk> <unk>
In half an hour. Yeah.
And while there's a lot of ways to remember things in these competitions, absolutely all the techniques used at the end is reduced to a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It is illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the paradox <unk> <unk> says this: I say to two people who remember the same word, I say to you, <unk> there's a man named <unk>
That's your <unk>
And then I'm asking you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them to tell you that word I told you a <unk>
So what do you want?
The person who was told that his name is <unk> it's unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said that their job is <unk>
The same word, different capability. That's weird.
What about here?
Well, the name Baker, really does not mean nothing to you. There's no relationship to you.
With all the other memories that dance for his head.
But the word, <unk> we know <unk>
They use white hats.
They have <unk>
They were fine when they come home to work.
Probably <unk> some <unk>
And when you go to that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point later.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this is two years ago, in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> I attended a <unk>
They had hired him as entertainment, because before, if he wanted to give a very good party, you didn't bring a <unk> <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up <unk> his memory poem, and he was <unk> and so soon he was the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were going to get everybody.
But not only it killed everyone, but it shattered the bodies -- <unk>
Nobody could say who was there, nobody could remember where you were sitting there.
So they couldn't afford the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
I was standing outside, only survivor, in the middle of the rubble, shut up the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where he was sitting every single <unk>
I took the family of my hand <unk> where their loved ones were in the rubble.
What <unk> pick up at that moment is something that we all know about more or less <unk> and it is that no matter whether we're not good to remember names or phone numbers or instructions or instructions that are the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and exceptional memory.
If I told you that I was telling you, the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to make them very hard to do it.
But I would bet that if you told them to tell you to say who I was sitting on the horse on the brown promise in his lobby, would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory palace is to create this building with the eyes of their mind and image of images with the things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first <unk> memory in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to do this memory in the same way that I would have made it <unk> if they had been invited to <unk> years ago.
What you might do is imagine you are at the door of your house.
And to come up with some sort of absolutely <unk> <unk> crazy <unk> to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine moving into your house, and see the <unk> on the <unk> mounted on <unk> <unk>
And that will remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to tell.
And then in the kitchen, and the fourth issue that they talk would be that strange journey that they made for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
This is how <unk> speakers, <unk> their narratives -- not word for word that is going to mistake it but typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people thought about <unk> and the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> first would be like the first place in his palace of memory.
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got stuck with that.
I went to some of these skills of memory and had the idea of writing something extensive about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is an event, boring event.
But seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting by taking exams. I mean, that the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets <unk> the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes all the <unk> before you sit on see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient school <unk> bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered this was a lot of fun.
You would never have waited for him to get it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What it's actually about doing is to get more and more the ability to create and imagine these images that are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was pretty excited about this.
This is me, using my standard training team for the competence of memory.
It's a pair of <unk> and some security glasses covered with tape leaving only two <unk> because the distraction.
And I ended up coming back to the same competition that I'd covered a year before, I had the idea that you could enter there, in a kind of <unk> <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be a good job for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment went out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to be able to <unk> and numbers of phone numbers, and it's not really <unk> but actually this is not the point.
These are just just tricks.
Because they are based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And it doesn't need to be able to build <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> to benefit from a little bit of insights about how their mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift of <unk> but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
And so we focus on it as we focus on.
The palace of <unk> these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
It will be a kind of profound processing, a kind of a complete attention that most is not going on <unk>
But the reality is that there are no shortcuts.
That's how things are doing <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, is what I would have to do with you today -- that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, let me leave me that is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose from what is already our <unk> existence in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who is going to be so <unk> that we didn't even bother to process in <unk>
I learned firsthand that there are amazing memory capacities for all of us.
But if you want to live a living, you have to be the kind of person you remember remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
This is a complex thing, so I would just put it up just a <unk> place, New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from North Carolina, I was six years old and lived there in my parents' home in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom as a child.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was an balcony that gave the living room.
And there they all spent the time watching television and so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, and I all looked at me, and every time I stood up, and I would come back, and I would come back, and I would come back, and I was going back into a towel -- all of me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> insecure and hated it.
<unk> that journey, I hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
OK.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture -- because architecture is not about mathematics, or division of areas, but of those connections -- emotional connections, which we feel in the places that are <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel like that way, because according to the Environmental <unk> Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under ceiling.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture will determine us in ways we don't even realize it.
That makes us a bit of naive and very, very predictable.
That means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you do, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know they think about it as a building in a building a half thousand years ago, by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that used architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century in America, we use it to build houses.
Look, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
People who are doing the <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways they know they're going to work.
So we met with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Library of <unk> which was ended in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, has this <unk> has this round thing, columns, brick red, which <unk> what <unk> is trying to communicate with this <unk> kids, the values of property history.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, was ended up another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works at the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is <unk> architects constantly drive new technologies, new technologies, new solutions for living forms for today's lives.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> so we get out of the people.
And all of the black -- this is <unk> you think we feel very good, but we're dead in the inside because we don't have another option.
We need to go on the other side and come back to connect with these symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we are all happy, so we started to experiment with <unk> We do <unk> the beginning to go forward, and over and over again, so we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago from the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with so-called <unk>
It's about the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, large-scale scale.
Something really hard.
So we get to the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
<unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
We take those forms that we know that like and <unk>
They <unk> <unk> and we add a lot of new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took closets <unk> and we made them a skyscraper that can be <unk> <unk> made of glass.
The forms was <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
The <unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
madness.
But it was the '80s, that was great.
We all spend the time in commercial centers, we move to the slums, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to French or Italian or Italian ones.
There may be an infinite pair of sticks.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They're easy -- they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we set up memories of other places.
I know very well, and all of you know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
Architects feel frustrated and we started making <unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
In the '80s and early '90s, we started to experiment with so-called <unk>
<unk> the <unk> symbols now we have to have new <unk> design techniques, and we find ourselves with new <unk> some forms that are associated with other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You are totally <unk>
Normally, the pendulum <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then, something <unk>
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when <unk> academics and public in general, were completely according to a building.
The New York Times <unk> <unk> this <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao grew up to two percent when they ended up the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these wild and wild forms, how is it possible that it will become a ubiquitous way around the world?
And it happened, because the media <unk> around them and quickly learned that those forms meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these shapes.
The same thing did the major mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon in the beginning of the new millennium country with other prime architects star.
And I went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium, actually began to move through all of architecture.
Think of how you eat architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked up to the next town to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, an airplane can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and at the end, we're all photographers in architecture, and the building is transported beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere right now, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It's not very accurate for thinking about a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings, before we knew if that one I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we find buildings like this.
<unk> was not a <unk> movement, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to come back to <unk> Because we are at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of <unk> steel or <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when you apply the pendulum to media, it starts to get faster and faster, until we will be in both extremes almost in <unk> and it was effectively <unk> the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, architects and you, the public.
We can now make symbols almost <unk> with emotional charge of something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a holiday community.
But that meant that two years before the building would end up the building, it was part of the community. And as the drawings looked exactly like the finished, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people started to come and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a media, because these are not just images of a building, it's the images that you made the building.
And as you use them to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative -- and that makes it <unk> with the collective memory, and when you charge these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but they have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think for a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built today, first of <unk> the Internet for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to people of <unk> and tell you that there's no one answer to what a library is today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that are using <unk> words and beautiful drawings and one is no longer an <unk> public that doesn't support something I haven't seen before.
And architects can listen, and you don't leave it for architecture.
That means that the pendulum <unk> from one style to another movement, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find solutions right to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that buildings in the morning will be very different from buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be only and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn may be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historical cap of red brick based on ideas of what a stadium.
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we finally will be ready for the ways that they're going to produce.
That means that the buildings were <unk> to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a <unk> garage in Miami Beach, Florida, can also serve to do sports or to <unk> or even you can get married in the night.
This means three architects can dream of swimming in the East <unk> New York, and raising half a million dollars of the community connected around that cause, it's no longer a client alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot that builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we build.
The architects already know how to make more <unk> buildings, smarter and more kind.
We've been waiting for everyone to you.
Finally, we're not very <unk>
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot in play.
Buildings are not just reflecting our society, but they shape the way up to the most <unk> spaces the local libraries -- the homes where we form our children, and the <unk> to the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it makes it really great, typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is to look at the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
<unk> and <unk> and it gives itself those big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
But apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and I was thinking, "How do I stop doing this?
How do we suddenly be comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for in Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It's a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though his mom tells him all the time that it's beautiful, every day in school, somebody says it's ugly.
Among what their mom says and what his friends, or colleagues are told, don't know who to believe.
So a video of her itself, he publishes it on YouTube, and he asked others who please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm nice or <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has received over 13,000 images.
Some of these are so <unk> who doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal regular teenager, normal and <unk> who receives these answers into one of the most vulnerable life of their life.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly girls trying to communicate this way.
But what's going to do this?
Well, teenagers are almost never alone.
They're under pressure from being online and available all the time, talking about, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we have been so connected in a continuous way, so young.
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in his room all the <unk>
There's simply no privacy.
And the social pressures coming from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, of being always connected, it's <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of things that they have and the kinds of comments that they do.
There's no division between a online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what it's real or what it is.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what's authentic and what it is to be rigged for.
What is the most prominent thing in life of someone in front of what is normal in a day?
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of girls now.
<unk> <unk> continue to dominate our <unk>
The <unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people compare that.
But kids are also also immune to this.
Like the ones of the superheroes of sport, and the singers would come.
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to grow healthy individuals and be individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our kids to spend more time and effort effort to their appearance, at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capabilities and their studies and other things start to suffer.
Six in 10 girls prefer to do something because they think they don't look good enough.
These are not <unk>
They are fundamental activities for its growth as human beings and the way they end up with society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in <unk> arguments, engaging in the classroom in classroom because they don't want to call attention for their physical <unk>
One of five are not teaching classes at all during the days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the test season if you don't think you look at good enough, specifically, if you don't think you're thin, good enough, you get a note to the average of your peers who don't care about how they appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, America and China, in China.
And it doesn't matter irrespective of what they actually weigh these young people.
So, to be clear, we are talking about how you see you, not what you're really like.
The low self-esteem on its body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk>
The teenagers with low self-esteem do less physical activity, eating less fruits and vegetables, they participate in more diet -- not healthy that they can bring them to a food disorder as well.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people surrounding them and they're in higher risk of depression.
And we think it's all about this for what they make more <unk> decisions like the consumption of alcohol and <unk> diets -- aesthetic surgery, <unk> aesthetic sex sex and no protection and <unk> damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing into the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they're overweight again, regardless of whether or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
On 17 percent of women don't present to a job interview in a day where they don't feel secure with the way you see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would we be able to overcome that.
And we will have this potential for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, talking about itself, it doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key forms. The first one is that we have to instill trust in your own body.
We have to help our teens to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are a lot of programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that many <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that follows our children will not only have a positive impact, but also an academic impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focus on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are starting to be crucial points for anyone willing to provide education in body self-esteem that works.
A education is fundamental -- but dealing with this problem requires each of us to take disease into the issue, and let's be a better model for women and girls in our own lives.
I defy the status of the way the women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the <unk> that determination or the success of a Olympic athlete depends on that it's not a big beauty.
We need to begin to judge people by what they are, not as you see.
All of us can start doing it by taking responsibility for the kind of images and the comments we published in our social networks.
We can engage people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, When was the last time you get a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as communities, and as companies, to really change our culture, so that our children will grow to be valuing the entire person, valuing the diversity, the <unk>
We need to put people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that go out on the big screen because we will just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where they think they see you can see that they can be seen by being who they are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who have in mind?
His <unk>
His <unk>
His <unk>
His <unk> A <unk>
It could be simply the woman who is two car seats -- what would it mean for her if she was released from that voice <unk> in his interior, that he would remind him for not having long legs -- make it more skinny, a <unk> <unk> feet <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were <unk> this and we would call their potential <unk>
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are leaving us all.
But we get to our children the truth.
So let me tell you that the way you see is just one part of your identity, and the truth is that we love the love of the ones and what they do, and because of how they make us feel.
<unk> to self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about, and we compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of today, they will become long-term agents of yourself tomorrow.
Let's do it.
On November five of 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the Defense Defense League <unk>
<unk> initially said it innocent but being a prisoner for other <unk> on the company of others, they started planning for <unk> attacks of New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Luckily, those plans to be used by an informant in the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb bomb in the World Trade Center, couldn't escape it.
Later on, he would be convicted of their participation on that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
And I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer who had a <unk> who was a loving mother, a primary school teacher in elementary school.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims come to know.
For experience, I saw that when people take time to interact with it, it doesn't require a lot to wish the same things in life.
However, in all of religion, in all of the human group, there are always a tiny fraction of people who were <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that thinks we need to use all the possible media so that they all lived like them.
A few months before he arrest him, he sat down with me and explained that in the last weekends, he and some friends, had been going to go training in Long Island to practice.
He said I would go with him the next day.
We got to the shooting <unk> which, without knowing our group, was tested by the FBI.
When I touched my father <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to point to the goal at about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that I shot gave the little orange light on the goal and, to surprise everybody, especially of me, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle turned to the rest and in Arabic, he said, <unk> <unk>
As a parent, such a child.
All of all, the comment gave them a lot of laughter. But just a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
They saw me in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be convicted of putting a <unk> <unk> of explosives in the underground parking lot of the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and <unk> to other 1,000.
I admired those men.
I called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times. That instability during my childhood was not allowed to do a lot of friendships.
Every time I started feeling comfortable close to someone was already <unk> and getting to another city.
As I was always the new side of the class that was often a victim of <unk>
<unk> my identity to avoid being the white -- but it will be the new of the quiet class, and he was <unk> it was enough <unk>
So most of the time happened in my home reading books, watching television or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't develop social skills, to put it very <unk> for growing <unk> I was not prepared for the real world.
I was raised in opera to judge people, based on <unk> indicators as their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they set out to test my way to think, was during election presidential elections.
In a <unk> program that I participated in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence, as I had been a victim of <unk> almost my entire life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids we had made friendship, was Jewish was Jewish age.
And I took a number of days out of the light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly, I felt very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that all life had made me believe it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer job in Bush -- an amusement park.
I found myself with people from all sorts of beliefs and cultures, that experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
Every life had taught me that <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay beings were bad <unk>
I had a chance to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the <unk> and less critics than I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others. But it wasn't easy for me to treat people like <unk> exactly the way I wish it would be treated.
For that feeling I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what that is about being homosexual but I know what it is to be trial and something beyond my control.
Then he came the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me <unk> honest with my <unk> and I was helping me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, has nothing to do with character.
In many ways he became my shape <unk> at a moment where I was desperately <unk>
Occasionally, the inspiration can come from the unexpected and a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to thinking, and she told me something to keep in my heart forever, while it's alive.
She looked at me with your head tired of somebody who has suffered enough with endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that time, I realized how much negative energy is needed to keep all that hatred inside your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break my relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why would I go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope somebody's one day, who is trying to take the violence to the violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way than I was telling me to this violent ideology, <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against the prejudice.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, because of the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
So by the victims of the terrorism we speak against those <unk> <unk> as rejection of my father's actions.
And with this simplicity -- I put here as a proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race -- that children don't have to follow the roads from their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you all.  Thank you very much.
At this point, there's a film that is projects in their minds.
It's an incredible <unk>
It's in 3D, and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and you see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has an <unk> taste and texture.
You feel your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as a moment of your childhood that's project to your eyes.
And it's constantly a voice superimposed on your conscious thinking.
The <unk> heart is you who experience everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the mind of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths about human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an inner film -- you, you and you.
There is nothing to get more directly.
At least I do know that I have an awareness of it.
I don't need to be aware of you.
Consciousness is also the reason for living.
If we were not aware, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why aren't we just robots that we get to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
The science, by nature, is objective
<unk> for nature, is subjective things.
So there's never a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, we would have that vision.
psychology is studying finance behavior, neuroscience was studying the mental brain, but never no one mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis <unk> and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for science to <unk> the <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the search for correlations correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that introduced Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand a lot better, for example, areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of looking at faces or feel happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of <unk>
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain to you that this kind of work of neuroscience answers some questions that we want to explain your consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain and what they are <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
Not to offend the <unk>
Actually, there is no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't address the real mystery of this <unk> why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is an internal movie <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like the <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors -- how do they work <unk> how do they work, how they are <unk> they adapt and <unk> the living organisms, these are all questions about the functioning work.
And that could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we do it, how we talk about how we play <unk> how we play <unk> are all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why it's that all behavior is accompanied by an amazing experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a real scientific <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that would work. For a long time, I hit the head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to get to this point.
We have a wonderful wonderful chain, great. We get used to this; physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to manipulate that idea to our scientific vision in the world.
I think consciousness, right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate our worldview in the world, but we don't know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need some radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning of <unk> <unk> before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today has one.
Your crazy idea is that there is no such problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the subjective film movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you need to do, is to explain the functions of the brain -- the behaviors of the brain, and this is studies everything that needs an explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply to deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying as much.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
We physicists are sometimes taking some aspects of the universe as <unk> <unk> space, time and mass.
We have fundamental laws that <unk> them as the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of anything more basic.
Instead, they look at each other, and that's what the world is built.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts <unk> space, time, masse, laws of Newton. And so I applied the basic charge of the <unk> and <unk> the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws are <unk>
I think that's the situation we find ourselves with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas <unk> space, time, <unk> charge, then because of logic, you have to <unk> the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> consciousness as a fundamental thing, a fundamental platform of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science, right?
It opens up the way for <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect awareness with other fundamental concepts -- the space, the time, the mass processes.
We physicists sometimes say we want to do very simple laws that we can put it into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws that we can put it into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by all, <unk> for mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, the dogs, the mice, flies, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of heartbreak when he thinks I was always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that maybe photons can have some element of raw feeling that gives you some primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would anyone think about something that crazy?
Some of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is critical.
If it's fundamental, as space, time and mass is natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful reason to find fundamental laws that <unk> thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever you have information processing, and there's awareness.
<unk> of complex <unk> like in a human being, consciousness complex.
<unk> of simple information, it's simple.
One very exciting thing is that in recent years a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, I took this kind of theory and developed it by mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of integration of information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And it's not supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there's a means of integration integration information, just as significant degree of consciousness quite important.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of integration of information is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of consciousness from zero.
In fact that <unk> a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
In addition, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers have observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality behind the underneath.
How Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire <unk>
From vision -- the equations of physics can be left as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire on the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not outside of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right at the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship to nature, and it can have very serious ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I didn't have to eat anything that had consciousness, then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you embrace that vision, you'll get very hungry.
I think that I think about doing this, this tends to transform your <unk> whereas what matters in the ethical terms, and moral <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of information <unk> she has a complicated complicated processing processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they have a pretty serious ethical problems about the ethics of the development of smart computers and the <unk> <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of collective collective <unk> the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or at a more local level, a more local group, as the audience at a TED Talk -- right now, we have a TED consciousness -- an inner film for this whole whole group of TED -- different from every single one of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least is a question you should take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually more secure from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, than the second one, which is universal.
So vision raises a lot of questions, a lot challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love us.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go through the right path towards a theory of serious consciousness.
If not, well, it's probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we finally will find it out.
Understanding consciousness is the true key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile, a under education.
I went to school, I went with my friends, my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to hold it for a community in the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's a obvious.
She's actually not getting anything."
I went to school, I had good notes. After school, I had a beneath my mother, my mother, and spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> series the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing can be considered as a achievement if we took the disability outside of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching me in a high school of <unk> so only after about 20 minutes in the class 11 of <unk> <unk> a boy raised the hand and said, "Hey, when give you your <unk>
And I said, "What do you do?"
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for some good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in the wheels, they talk about things <unk> at school?"
<unk> in the classroom.
And it was then when I realized, this child had had experienced experiences with disabled objects.
And we don't know it -- and it's not <unk> I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, individuals with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We're there to inspire.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair, and you're probably waiting for you. Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they have lied to disability.
Yes, they have sold us the lie that disability is something <unk> which is a capital <unk>
It's a bad thing and living with a disability makes you fantastic <unk>
It's not a bad thing and you can't make you fantastic <unk>
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad deal.
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one of the girl with no hands with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a kid running with carbon fiber
And there's a lot of these images, which is what we call porn inspiration from.
And I use the porn term <unk> because they brought a group of people to the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, <unk> the disability in the benefit of people without disabilities.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad that my life, could be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the number of times that they have been dealing with strange <unk> to express that I am a brave or a source of inspiration, and this would happen before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I was standing in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images will inspire people with disability to people without disabilities.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a tough thing.
Let's get some things.
But the things we overcome are not the things you can think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was called the social model of disability, that tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
The things I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of your ability to do as well as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures too.
They're not doing anything outside of the common.
They're simply using their bodies by taking away the best of their ability.
So, it's really just <unk> in the way we do, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it tells us like a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have sold this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "For God, you're not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And I actually know that I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't know that I am fortunate than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use <unk> to collect the things that fall over.  <unk> the ingenious trick of how to load the battery out of the mobile phone in the chair.
Great.
We learn from the strength and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that you have sold about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true -- because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in front of a strain has not made it never become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> to a TV screen won't make the subtitles for people <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl sitting in his bedroom is looking at <unk> the <unk> <unk> not being considered to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of the people with disability that we are <unk> to rise in the bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the real achievement of people with disability, and I want to live in a world where a kid from 11 degree in a high school in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk>
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but questioning what you think to know about what it does.
Thank you.
What do the reality do you have to do <unk> and <unk> with the <unk>
What is the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, today I'm just responding to one of those questions, so please, not <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think in "Minority <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know about, because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So, how do we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I'm wearing the Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows you to see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is being a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to make it <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you fill with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what is running through the game of game to 160 <unk> blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man from 110 pounds -- we were trying to touch it with everything else.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
So let's get some videos to show you what is using Google <unk> under the helmet, give you a sense of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of <unk> practices because the idea of the <unk> of the emerging technology is a submarine rising up to the surface.
So let's see a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
So a moment. Let's get a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is being <unk> in the football field from <unk> perspective.
You may have realized that lack of people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> mice. Mice <unk> Mice <unk>
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more like being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, being their favorite players and asked me on YouTube and <unk> it can be seen from the angle of a field of <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go from <unk> how we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which probably most of you know.
The Rift Valley has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why we have this video.
Man: Oh, Oh.
No, no, no, no, I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That is the experience of a man on a mountain, <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you put up a video of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before they run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of
When I could be <unk> running through the <unk> by releasing the ball to the bottom of the network? Or <unk> making a <unk>
What is your experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 miles an hour a <unk>
Maybe the sales for adults.
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get to the reality of <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality reality when the <unk> <unk> and owners see the information that people want to see and say, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win.
So, here's a quick refresher on the <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore put a <unk> to their field <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radios on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and after the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that they are a player coming back to your group, and you see their next piece of hand you get shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that they wear on. You don't have to worry about <unk> a <unk>
They or to memorize the strategy.
They just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, and they hate <unk>
If you lose parties like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But reality reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your own game.
So how do you do?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view of the top of the people who are down.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and the <unk> something that is already working on.
And all of that information is send you to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
evil will have <unk>
This is going to give the good teams of bad guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis to stop being <unk>
It's also going to be <unk> Who <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that you are the <unk>
And he <unk> the ball and <unk>
<unk> to a open receptor suddenly a <unk> on the left of your bombsight -- you would tell you that a defense behind you are going to <unk> Usually not <unk> but the system of <unk> will <unk>
Let's get to the area of protection.
Another <unk> makes you <unk> there's a open network.
You get the <unk> but they <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land. But the receptor sees in its bombsight a area of grass that lights up and can modify the career.
<unk> <unk> <unk> runs and <unk>
The real public and the fans have been followed by each angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality.
We're going to use it just like bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use reality reality to encourage empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is literally going to be in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much this technology is worth for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad their actions are from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives in <unk>
What is also worth a <unk> or a Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality comes close.
The questions we do and the challenges we face and the challenges we face, as always, from us.
Thank you.
I was <unk> after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years of the country -- the south end of the <unk> County, which includes the bridge <unk> <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known to its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The bridge <unk> <unk> was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer who would build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is almost <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to his death from that bridge.
Some of them believe that traveling between the two towers will bring them to another <unk> this bridge has been <unk> as such, so the each one from it gives you from all of your concerns and pain, and the waters that go underneath your soul.
But let me tell you what happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one every free of four to five seconds, the body hits the water roughly 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks the bones, some of which <unk> vital organs.
Most of the impact.
The ones that don't usually get stuck in the water <unk> and then <unk>
I don't think that the ones that are going to have this suicide method will realize the death of the death of the death that they <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches of steel parallel to the bridge.
This is where most people are in order to get away from their lives.
I can tell you about experience that once the person is on that edge, and in your darkest moment, it's very hard to bring them back.
I took this picture last year while this man was talking to an officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had a success that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
They were able to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who speak suicide, but the officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, officers, veterans and psychologists train the new official ones.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him the 22 <unk> last year when I got a so-called <unk> suicide bomber sitting on the <unk> near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to an official <unk> bridge.
Jason was only 32 years old, and it had flown up to here from New Jersey.
In fact, it had flown up here two times before from New Jersey to try and kill <unk> from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked if we knew the history of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology of <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out of <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What if you open the box up and there's no <unk>
He stopped <unk> leaned on the right, and he left.
This kind of kind of smart guy in New Jersey had just taken your life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the father of the family called me to see what it was.
The parents of Jason had had the order.
<unk> damage from suicide affects a lot of people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved out suicide <unk>
What do you find?
So what do you say?
In my experience, you don't only have to speak, but you have to listen.
Listening to understand.
Don't say <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels like to feel -- because you probably don't know.
It's just being there, you can be the inflection point that they need.
If you think that someone is <unk> you won't be afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is, <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about their life, you've had these <unk>
He <unk> the person in front of it can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, to believe that things are terrible and they never go to <unk> <unk> believe that there's nothing you can do to the <unk> social isolation, and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I would like to read you his letter.
She lost his son on January 19, this year, and he wrote to me this email just a couple of days, and it's with her permission and blessing that I read her.
"Hi, <unk> I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go on the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell many people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell their friends, and so on.
I'm still pretty <unk> but noticing more moments of realize that Mike will not go home.
Mike was driving to San Francisco to San Francisco to see the party of 49 with his father on the 19th <unk>
It never came there.
I called the police of <unk> and the <unk> like disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my home and reported me that the car <unk> was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the late day.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been wrong without having a real severe disease.
It shouldn't be so easy to end with it.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
The <unk> the <unk> Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk into the path that his son took that day, and also the courage to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man who refer to hope and value.
On March 11th of 2005, I replied to a radio call for a possible guy at the front of the bridge near the <unk>
I was going on the sidewalk and I watched this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When I saw me, cross the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
Over the hour and a half later, I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and <unk>
Kevin decided for his mind that day will come back on that lane and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin got <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What did it do that he made him <unk> and he loves the hope and life <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "Can you <unk>
You stopped talking and simply <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from his mother, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the <unk> events of March, and you're one of the reasons that Kevin is still with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
I started Kevin when I was only six months, completely unconscious, from all those traits -- <unk> but, thank God, we know we know.
Kevin is in order, like <unk>
We give God for you.
<unk> debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she writes to her, <unk> When I visited the General General in San Francisco tonight, that night, you love the patient.
I thought I had to do it <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and a active member of society.
It speaks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story will inspire others.
<unk> is not just something that I've been found in the work.
It's personal.
My grandfather got <unk> with poison.
That act, despite the end of his own pain, theft.
This is what suicide.
For most people, or those people who think about when you don't think about hurt another person.
They just want their own pain.
Usually this is actually achieved by three things: sleep, drug or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and calls around the bridge.
In those incidents I've been directly involved -- I've just lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
And for that time, I had my hand in three times.
In the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those guys who have jumped from the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or <unk> most of those people have said that the second of those people who leave aside the railing realized that they made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or a bridge that we do, is something that each and every one of us must be used to do.
<unk> can be prevent.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world causes you to be what you don't are, but inside you know what you are, and a question is, how do you become on that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone, but I'm not alone.
When I became a model I felt that he finally had achieved the dream that I had ever had.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth, with my inner self.
So for the reasons that I'm going to go over later, when I look at this picture, I think, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But last October, I found that <unk> I'm very beginning.
We all have our families, our religion, our religion, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of our imposed on the color of the skin or the beliefs of those around us.
They're people who are always challenging the status -- which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my even ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called revelation.
This is mine.
They recorded as <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this t-shirt on the head.
And my mom wondered, "Why are you always wearing that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, is a more complex and mystery thing.
Because of my success, I will never tell me to share my story, not because I thought it will be a bad thing, but why the world is all of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mom, my dad and a family who accept me as I am.
Many are not so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in Indian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was in a party in the Philippines that celebrated these mysteries.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came in front of me, and I remember that moment as something like this: This is the kind of woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I still had a man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the CEO of a <unk> beauty competition.
That night, she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she was <unk> she was <unk> on the <unk> and the <unk> and that night, I won in <unk> and I won in <unk> and he got a third <unk> in the over 40 candidate candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was from Queen of beauty of women, <unk> but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when he <unk> to the remote <unk> of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom. who had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that he passed my statement from the green card that could go to the U.S.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and he said, "You know that if you love the United States you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to me I put two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was <unk> in Thailand to 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do the most sophisticated surgeries and secure.
At that time in the U.S., it was necessary to be done before the name of the name and gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's driver's license, and the gender <unk> <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means power to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears were <unk>
I felt like I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and being model.
Many are not so fortunate.
I think of this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who had lived his truth, but he <unk> he raised his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All the 20th of November we do a global vigil by the Day of <unk>
I'm on this stage thanks to a long history of people that <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are <unk> P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, no fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that someday there is no more <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
You're you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Right. <unk> first, thank you to all my <unk>
In my support network, my parents especially, to my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the time that I've been to young women -- young women who have <unk> and sometimes when they were called me and told me that their parents could not accept it, I would take the phone, called my mom and she said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- other not. It's just gender identity, that's what is at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, everybody was assigned to us, gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is to put on the table the subject that sometimes a block, and that there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very little. <unk> Thank you.
In many ways, the tribal parents are usually known for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for their daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending his rights in 2007. And when his efforts were <unk> in 2011, to the <unk> the National <unk> of peace, became very famous -- a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when at birth a child, his birth is not <unk>
It's not welcome, not for his father, not for his mother.
The neighborhood comes, it gives their <unk> to the mother, and no one was going to <unk>
And a mother got a lot of <unk> for having a child.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, it gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a child, when he went to her third daughter, you feel guilty like a criminal.
Not just the mother <unk> but the daughter was just <unk> The daughter was just <unk> when it grows, too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, you get home and school to her siblings.
Up to age 12 in a way, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and it can move on the streets as a butterfly.
But when you go into adolescence, when it is 13 years old, you have to come up with your house without a male <unk>
It's confined to four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the honor of his father and his brothers and his brothers and his family and his family, and if you had the code of that course honor, it could even kill.
And it's interesting that this assumption code is not only the life of a <unk> it also affects the life of the male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the <unk> of his life and the happiness of his sisters in behalf of the honor.
And there's a bigger rule of societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the <unk>
The model of a good girl should be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and to support the decisions of their father and mother and people's decisions, even if they don't will.
If you go through it, with a man who doesn't like or if he <unk> it with an old man, he has to <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk> of <unk>
If the very young <unk> has to accept it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens at the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> the <unk> and then gives birth to younger and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson of honor their children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
They were pregnant brothers and sisters, when he was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like our newborns, to be honest, but when I was there, and I looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt hugely <unk>
And so much before I was thinking about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and he called my daughter for her.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line out of my name, and wrote, <unk>
And when she came up when she was four and a half and a half years old, I went through my school.
You might ask, why should I mention a girl in a school?
Yeah, I must <unk>
You can give it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in societies in societies in tribal societies, is a great event for the human life.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of your identity and his name.
A <unk> to school means that it's entered the world of dreams and the aspiration where it can explore its potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be spent two weeks before, when they were <unk> the form of a tourist <unk> and I was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I was never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason for my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and her daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to see me.
The encouraged to go to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and girls in the same way.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> to my daughters, I taught the students, forget the lesson of <unk>
I showed you the students to forget the lesson of called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we find a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights and, in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's participation in all of the political and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and let the markets.
The musicians were <unk> young girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, <unk> got up and got down the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC blog was offered her himself for the New York Times, and he spoke in every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
They <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign and October nine of 2012, he was fired in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I would give me the ear to my wife -- <unk> <unk> so I went to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> told me, "Please, don't you?"
It will be fair cause.
<unk> your life in play for the cause of truth, because of the cause of peace, and for the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and you get paid.
They were both on the right path and God <unk>
These few words <unk> a lot to me, and I didn't start asking again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and had severe and strong headaches.
But my daughter is never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile <unk> and in my face.
I'm going to do well. Please do it for you."
It was a comfort for us, and we were <unk>
I read brothers and sisters, we've learned from her to resist the most difficult moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for children and women and women, it's like any girl of 16 years.
<unk> when you don't finish his task.
You fight with his brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What's special about my <unk> who has made so audacious to <unk> so brave and expressive and <unk>
I mean, I don't ask me what I did.
I didn't know what I did.
I didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> in the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion for me.
I'm engineering engineering.
And I want to tell you that I recently teamed up with the Google <unk> <unk> where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the Google Google visualization -- but all the work that I'm talking about here today about the science of the brain, I did before I join Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there's a stigma when you get to a brain machine.
You're still just as smart or not?
Of course, it's not going to be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It was not gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
After the operation, I had to decide what amount to take, from more than a dozen different powerful chemicals every day, because if I did not take anything, die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and mix and try to get it to keep alive.
More than once I've been saved by little.
But luckily, I have a soul to <unk> so I decided that I decided to try to get the <unk> dose, because there is really no one map that says it in <unk>
I started testing with different <unk> and I was amazed by looking at how small changes in the <unk> dramatically -- my sense of who I was, my way to think, my behavior with others.
One particularly <unk> case, for a few months, I tried a dose and the typical chemicals for a man of <unk> and I was surprised to see how my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sexual sex, and I was believed that it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met several guys like this, or maybe some versions of the <unk>
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> so much <unk> fixing a problem that I had in the front, and it just doesn't happen to happen.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that that experience gave me a new appreciation for men and about what they have to do, I mean, I've been better at men.
And what I tried to do is we could adjust those hormones and they <unk> and so forth, I was to recover my intelligence after the disease, and the <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
<unk> thinking almost always in pictures, and that became my point of key reference -- how to make those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> and new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things like that.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are the people who are looking at this idea, and there are a lot of arguments about how your mind works, for me is simple: for most of us, the mental imagery are fundamental to thinking and <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I got to find the point right and I have a lot of great <unk> mental <unk> it really <unk> sophisticated sophisticated <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images, of my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a theater director would be able to use his imagination only to drive the world to <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There are amazing possibilities with this, like the way the creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to achieve this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to get to this with two recent experiments that were done by two different groups in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, MRI imaging imaging -- to represent the brain here, you can see the scanning brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and their colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scanning of the brain of a person looking at an image.
The middle column shows the scanning of the brain of that same individual as you were <unk> seeing that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the content of the central column on the left. You see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is repeated in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same picture.
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is the lab in Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert the brain waves into visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, it showed the people hundreds of hours of YouTube YouTube videos while their brains would be able to create a big facility of brain reactions in the brain sequences in the music.
And then they showed them a film with new images and new people, new animals, and as a new <unk>
So the computer, using just the scanning brain information to show you what it looks like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the computer <unk> and on the left, the video that I showed you.
And so this gave us <unk>
We're very close to doing that.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see a picture and when you can imagine that same image, you create in the brain the same <unk>
This was done with the brain scanning systems of most available available today, and its resolution up a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How did we do that?
There are a lot of techniques to do it.
One is opening up the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
Many of them are proposing new projection techniques for images, even me, <unk> with the recent outcome of the MRI -- first we have to ask the next thing, this technology will be the end of the way of the table.
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get higher resolution is with bigger magnets -- but at this point, magnets more <unk> only offer small improvements in the resolution, not increases by thousands of as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of bigger magnets -- let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements like doing a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a great amount of effort in MRI were to make really big, right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> of bright and brilliant solutions of <unk> and <unk> in <unk> and <unk> radio receivers in MRI systems.
At the same time, instead of a magnetic field, <unk> magnetic patterns -- structured magnetic patterns.
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of the frequencies of radio frequencies -- we can actually increase a massive form of information that can be made in one <unk>
And we can then divide into layers our growing knowledge about the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
When we use <unk> we should be able to measure not just the blood fluid, but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and perhaps even the direct neural activity that's sleep.
We're going to be able to put our ideas in a direct media to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how can we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is big.
These are great questions.
It would be irresistible to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
We have a few more choices to open this door.
Anyway, you choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about this night about coming out of the closet, and not just in a traditional sense, not just the gay.
I think we all have <unk>
Her closet to maybe be told to tell some person for the first time you love it, or tell someone who is pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have ever been interested in in life.
Everything is a hard conversation -- and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and to have come out of that closet.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working in the South Side of the South Side -- <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through a number of phases of the <unk> <unk> <unk> -- my armpits, quote the letters of <unk> gave me like a <unk>
And I'll be the slope of my pants a short <unk> and I had my head <unk> I would say, normally a kid would say, "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And he would appear to be uncomfortable on the table.
I had my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father was <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother threw a cold, look at his son.
But I would not say anything, and it was <unk>
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that next time I would say something.
So that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened.
"You are a kid or a <unk>
A family silence, but this time I was prepared and I was about to walk into the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes on Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
And then I took it deep down, and I went down and my back, a four-year-old kid with a pink dress with a pink dress -- staring at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "Is there a kid or <unk>
And then I took a profound breath again, I put on <unk> near her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is a <unk>
I have the short hair like one of a boy, and I see clothes, but I'm a girl, and you know, like you like to use a pink dress -- and sometimes you like to use a pajamas.
I am more than a girl from a pajamas.
And that little girl looked at me with paying attention, and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all. I just ah, you're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the easiest conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some cabinets in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside the dark, you can't know what color are the walls.
You just know how it feels like to be living in a closet.
It's like my closet to do this is not different from yours or yours or yours.
<unk> I'll give you 100 reasons why to get out of my closet to get out of my closet to get out of your life, but this is the thing: it's hard to be not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that to explain to somebody who has declared in banking bench is harder than saying it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I say is more difficult to say to your five-year-old <unk>
There's no more difficult thing -- there's only the hard.
We need to stop classifying what is hard to deal with how hard for anyone else to make us feel better or worse in relation to our cabinets and we should just feel empathy because we all live something difficult.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make sure security, or at least more security than what the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what your walls are made -- I am not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, I had a horse of horse -- a dress and <unk> shoes.
It was not the lesbian <unk> <unk> to fight any child four years to go into the coffee.
I was frozen for fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark corner, <unk> my gay, and the move only a muscle is the most scary thing I've ever done.
My family, my whole full friends, strangers who have spent my entire life trying to not <unk> and now the world was turning around to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't launch that <unk> you kill you.
One of my most momentous launches was my sister.
It was the first time that many people were invited to know that I was gay, and by doing my <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally I came to one where my parents were from my parents, people who knew I knew about years.
And after talking a moment, one of the women who were <unk> <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay narrative had begun.
Did you ever be in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> meet my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about <unk>
<unk> What is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite <unk> Will and Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in waiting to show you desperately his support, to get me to know that I was from my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband wears <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that time, like all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask for someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with someone, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you do.
It's like the hard conversations are still not going to be my strong point.
Ask anybody I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please look at this through the <unk> perspective, but you understand that what it involves coming out of anything else is the same thing.
Number one: Be real.
The armor. <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the cafe I had no <unk> but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> others must be able to know we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know that they're gay, <unk>
If you say to your parents that maybe they might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give you a false sense of hope.
And number three, and most important --  Let the complex complex.
You communicate your truth.
You will never be surprised.
And some of them can get injured safe, they get out of what they've done, but they're never sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some people will feel <unk> but that something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not yours do.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find out in a dark door, I've ever gotten a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And they may feel very themselves, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
So what is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence has seen the intelligence, a productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> which "The <unk> can think of is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a critical to the IT pioneers like Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, I would take a program to try and understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's take a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
So imagine that they are from a <unk> race that you don't know anything about the biology of the Earth or the neuroscience of the Earth and the Earth and the Earth's intelligence of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, which has no concept on the intelligence of the Earth, you'd see it forced to develop a physical theory that explain how, at a certain point in time, the asteroids that will <unk> the surface of a <unk> planet.
And so I claim this is the same question that understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that took place several years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that I think, I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be efficient, adjusted to the development of intelligence, and in particular, to development of universal states that will embrace the diversity of future form.
Finally, in the manufacturing movement, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to leverage the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to do complex tasks.
And so, by taking all these different themes and <unk> together, asking them for a number of years ago, there's a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's just an equation for intelligence.
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence I've ever seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a force -- F, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or to keep the open choices, with a force T, with the diversity of possible future futures -- Yes, to an imminent time, <unk>
In a nutshell, intelligence doesn't like it to be <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and maintain open choices.
And so, in mind this equation, it's natural to ask, what can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the human intelligence.
<unk> intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that the universes that produce more mess, or <unk> in their life should have to have to have to have to have a tendency to conditions for the existence of smart beings.
But what happens if that connection <unk> <unk> between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What happens if intelligent behavior is not only correlates with the production of entropy in the long term, but it actually comes directly from her?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy in the long term in any system that you can find in.
<unk> <unk> was able to spend multiple tests of animal intelligence, play games, and even making money <unk> actions, all of it without that you had to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a human standing without <unk> here we see <unk> automatically by a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave it a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability of equilibrium will have applications for humanoid robotics and human assistance technologies.
This ability for tools can have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate pulling away from extreme sides of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This ability to cooperation have interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
So for example, here we see this successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
Here we look at <unk> <unk> new connections in a social network where friends are constantly constantly getting their friends constantly and keeps the net right connected.
This same capacity of network network has also got applications in health care, in energy care and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, discovering it successfully and using the Panama Canal to expand the global level of the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in problems in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously to discover and run a <unk> strategy in a simulated series of actions, successfully increasing assets under their exponentially.
This ability for risk management will have huge applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of intelligent cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools, walk upright and social cooperation, all derived from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep irony.
So let's go back to the beginning of the use of the term -- the <unk> work -- there was always the concept that if <unk> machines, there'd be an rebellion <unk>
The machines were <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all of the concept of rebellion <unk> in the other way.
It's not the machines first become smart and then <unk> and try to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the impulse to take control of all the future possible is a fundamental principle that the <unk> of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise out of control, rather than being upside down.
Another important consequence is the search for target.
They often ask me, how do you find targets <unk> from this kind of <unk>
So my equivalent to that statement to go to the descendants of helping the descendants of artificial <unk> or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: intelligence should be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the restrictions on their own future.
Thank you very much.
We are at an inflection point in human history, something between stars and losing the planet we call <unk>
Even over the last few years, we've expanded our knowledge of how the Earth fits into the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission of NASA has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points to the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the faint intensity of stars when planets go ahead of them, and they block a little bit of that light that got us.
Data collected by Kepler show the sizes of the planets in addition to the distance there are between them and their mother.
In all together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their own.
And at the time, this gives clues about whether these planets that we find are livable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014 was the hottest <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that has been with us since millennia, they're now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we have caused on a global scale have rapidly <unk> our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a weather scientist, and I'm not <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet being influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone really interested in the search for life in the universe -- I can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invited a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know best -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world demonstrated this by a mission like the Kepler <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been livable in the past, and in part, is why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> track its surface for clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples of the <unk> atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Companies now offer not just short space flights but also the chance of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images are going to remind us to remind us the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with ideas and <unk> ideas compared to Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still stay in <unk> places with Mars.
Even in the <unk> and <unk> places of the Earth is fresh and full of oxygen that we are going to get our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement for the colonization of Mars and other planets will drag to a big and sad <unk> the implication, and the belief that Mars is waiting for us to save us from this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly livable Earth.
And so much that I like the exploration, <unk> I'm deep disagreement with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to address humanity is like imagine that the captain of the Titanic to say that the captain of the Titanic will be more late in the <unk>    Thank you.
But the goals for exploration exploration and the earth preservation is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding, to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
It's just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces, in the hostile areas of land, perhaps we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
Let me leave you with an experiment with the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked, I asked you to realize that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the existence of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the paradox paradox is that when civilizations become advanced enough to consider living between the stars, they lose the notion of how important the planets are to protect the origin of the planets that are <unk> this development.
It's arrogant to think that we just colonization, we will save us out of ourselves, but the planetary preservation and <unk> exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to put it into the hostile environments on Mars for the human presence, then we should be able to overcome the job even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I got my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized he didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were at the dining table, where I had <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all closed.
I thought I'd call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get there, and it was cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend of Jeff <unk> to spend night because I had a flight to Europe in the next morning, and I was <unk> from my passport and <unk>
<unk> expensive, but sure that it wasn't more expensive than a <unk> to a half night, so I thought, even though in spite of the circumstances, I had been stopped.
I'm <unk> and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases the heart rate -- we will reduce the levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thinking.
And when I got to the <unk> of <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that could put in his place, that I would think that was going to happen.
Or at least, if bad things happen, which is going to be the probability that it is a complete catastrophe for it.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> <unk> winner and a little embarrassed I told him that I broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me he had been practicing something called something called <unk> hindsight <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this a few years before, known as the <unk>
You all know what the <unk> is.
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts come and try and find out what went wrong, right?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and tries to figure out all the things that you might go wrong, then tries to figure out what can do to prevent things to happen, or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> they're not so <unk>
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, you know, a place for things that are <unk>
This sounds <unk> and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of the important things, where the good thing is, where the fish are, where the fish are, which is where the fish are going on, where the tribes are friends and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that was <unk> in the <unk> of London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone actually did the experiment, they cut the sense of <unk> and they still could find his nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing keys from the car, New reading and <unk>
So at home, you put a place for keys, a hook on the door, maybe a plate <unk>
For your passport, a particular drawer for your passport,
For their reading, a particular <unk>
If you go to a place and they are <unk> with it, your stuff will always be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take a picture of your credit cards, a picture of your credit cards, <unk> <unk> by email themselves to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can make the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases back.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
So part of the modern practice is to recognize that under stress will not be at the best moment, and you have to put the systems on its site.
And there is perhaps no more stressful than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, that we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or one to be dear to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And to talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of medical decisions, and actually for the decision-making of financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that we have to take from the rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose they go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I have received the outcome of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, heart injury.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you've heard about the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, even you're likely to know people who are <unk>
So you say, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you should do then, a statistic that you should ask for the most doctors don't want to talk about, and the drug companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number you need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or have surgery to have surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And you should think of what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor did not tell me if I wasn't to help me.
But actually, health practice doesn't work.
And it's not your doctor, and if it's somebody, it's about scientists like me.
We have not understood very well <unk>
But the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs work only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number need to treat the most widely <unk> which do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before you help a person?
300.
This is according to the research of researchers talking about <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> independently by <unk>
I'm going to explore the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding one single heart attack, stroke or another event.
Now you might think, "Well, one chance in 300 of my <unk>
Why don't we <unk> <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more, and it is, <unk> of the effects <unk> Yes?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of the patients.
And those include things that include <unk> and muscle pain and <unk> pain, but now they think, "The Five is not very likely to happen to me -- still take the <unk>
But a moment.
remember that under stress don't think clearly.
So think about how we can take this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of thinking on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get away from the drug for the drug to help you the drug.
I don't say they should not take the <unk>
I just say that you have to have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic needs it, is part of the early informed consent.
We have to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number need to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that the most is done in the older men of 50, prostate cancer prostate cancer, the number necessary to treat is <unk>
That's what it is, 49 surgeries for one person who has helped to.
And the side effects in that case is produced by 50 percent of the patients.
Those include <unk> or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you are lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can make that <unk> the conversation forward.
You don't have to make this all in the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice too many times, they want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that might have a lot of pain at the end?
These are the things they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you turn out a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Horse <unk> face with a predator, you don't need the <unk> system, or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending metabolism into those things, not very quickly.
Unfortunately, one of the things that's going through the window during those moments of stress is the rational thought rational thought as Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to focus on the future to these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail at time.
The idea is to think about the future how they might be those <unk> to put systems in the place that will help to minimize harm, or to prevent things wrong in the first place.
<unk> at the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor gave me a combination of combination with the door, along the door, with a key to the door door in the same way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered and lots of email messages I haven't read.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite music symbol for me.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely gentle.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be, I would never have a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I would like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> on addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came over the <unk> and over the time of the time, it was mixed with local signs, and developed the language that we now know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize that it's not true for anything.
<unk> are a very important part of my life, they're actually in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world, it's as if I lived in a foreign country, following reducing their rules, we would have <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand the sound?
Well, I see how people behave and they respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
You know, <unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've been learned, for example.
"Don't <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise by eating the bag of potato chips.
"Not <unk> and when you're just eating, you make sure you don't get stuck in the <unk>
All of this I call it <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag of what the average person does.
I'm super <unk>
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound that it's going to come next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> by decide.
They were going to move on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that the <unk> does not have notes on the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through subtle <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> culture, movement is the equivalent of sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do it with my thumb so it doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In the year 2008, I had a chance to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic residence there.
Before this time, I had worked as <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend, and that was called the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was hearing.
Now sound has entered my territory of art.
I'm going to tell you about art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that you don't just experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience it visually, or even like an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything I had taught me in the sound of sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the artistic community, it was <unk> with the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power -- the <unk> social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was something of a <unk>
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic job, or I could tell you about it.
I chose to tell me.
There's a massive culture around the speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me just like and become my voice.
So I'm able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in the work and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, for <unk> your voices, I am able to maintain a kind of temporary form of value as well as taking a loan on a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue this practice, I feel that it could be <unk> in the <unk> and not having any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot capture and express fully on paper.
And the same thing can be said about a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all of the signals as much as the sound of the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor of the piano, so you understand how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
The <unk> divide in many different <unk>
If you set up a different parameter for every finger while you touch the piano, like facial expression, the movement of the body, the speed, the shape of your hand and like that, while you touch the piano, English is a linear language, as if you were <unk> just a key <unk>
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers to be done to express a clear concept, or an idea in <unk>
If I just would change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens with music in terms of tone and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters -- you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> on that."
This is the <unk> signal in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> <unk>
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at the <unk> through music?
If I had to create a sign and put it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and they <unk>
This is all day."
If you get it, and you <unk> the speed, visually down, you see it as a piece of music.
The whole day.
I feel that the same can say that the same thing can be said about <unk> tonight."
All tonight."
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how the time does express the time in <unk> and how far the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is one hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body, and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the final one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, and it will be transformed by again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a <unk> <unk> <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically at <unk> same time."
Watch <unk> hand -- <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through your head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a form of hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All of them at high school.
Now we're going to do it as much in your head as your chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk> same time."
Yes, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a <unk> is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and languages around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please take away again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
So look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and the chest. But they make very differently.
It's amazing to see how <unk> is alive and thriving as the music.
However, today, we live in a very controversial world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have sounds, it doesn't have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow <unk> to develop its own value, no sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> not to be hearing music.
<unk> is a rich, and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to invite you to open his ears, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would tell me, "Can you tell them everything, but then you have to <unk>
<unk> involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a innocence of innocence or a bubble of ignorance -- I must say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I got older, I learned that adults are also <unk> and that they are not very good for each other.
The time I country, I'm now an adult and teach citizens and invention in the <unk> school of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait so much for my students to walk across the beach with lots and lots of garbage.
So as good citizens, cleaned up the beaches, and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of scary.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big fishing ships and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those huge <unk>
So along with my students, ages six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We began to build this <unk> <unk> <unk> so that kids very <unk> can also participate.
And I'll tell you the kids that manipulate electrical tools feel great and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce it to the size we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas in every child and try to focus on something we hope to work.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we take an image of this <unk> the children would get a lot with robots.
And then we created quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we transform light bulbs and cameras on top, and they put it into a floating robot, which is moving slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating slowly floating through the sensor while the computer on board and process this image and measure the size of every single <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention is going to step on a website to inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else will get them even more.
The cool thing in this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I'm able to investigate my problem -- but my students in Hong Kong are very good children.
Do you see the news, you look at the Internet, and you get it with this image: right?
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning a oil spill, just using the hands, in <unk> the world's largest forest in Bangladesh.
And they were really surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water that they spread the water where the water is coming in.
You can see also that the water is brown and the mud and the oil also are brown and when it's all <unk> it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> which can lead to all sorts of substances that produce different <unk> which can help to identify what's in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and we sent Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I was forced to find a problem to <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, maybe to address a harder problem, and also closest to me.
I'm half Japanese and a French half a French and a French and perhaps remember, that in 2011, there was an devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it had several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> <unk> several cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant in Fukushima, a nuclear power plant in the water.
And today, according to the reports of an average of 300 tons are still <unk> of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it looks like most of the radiation disappeared from the coast of the coast -- and the majority of the time, it has pretty safe and blue is blue.
Well, reality is a little more complicated than that.
I've come back to <unk> every year from the accident and inquiry independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to take the children.
Of course, not the <unk> the parents don't get it.
But every night we reported to the center of <unk> here you see the use of different masks here.
It might seem like they didn't take the serious work, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all his life.
Together with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and we talk about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the plant plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> <unk> to represent data in real time of <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
With this we were able to notice that the radioactive dust, <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> and <unk> system in the ocean.
It was an estimate <unk>
But based on this we organized a civil expedition as close to the nuclear power to date.
We are approaching a half miles of nuclear power -- and with the fishermen help of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a <unk> <unk> as we invented and build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it's been more frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage that we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom turned into so much so much, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we became the largest space dedicated to the social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, of optical lens, you can basically build almost all over there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can become reality with adults, and where adults can be kids again.
Students: <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with the renewable energy?
For example.
Or can we help in mobility of the old age transforming their concert lawn chairs into new vehicles in it.
The plastic, oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are the lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, citizen citizens, creators, we need to prepare the next generation to be cared for the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two radically opposite cultures.
One is made out of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of one dragline silk.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic thing.
One <unk> on the environment, the other he thought it was thought of it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> marble -- he saw a figure that struggle for being free.
<unk> was only <unk>
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took all of the information for every cell to work and to work for them.
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by manufacturing and production in mass.
The lines of assembly have <unk> a world made out of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think about their objects as <unk> of parts of <unk> different functions.
But you don't find any <unk> of material <unk>
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> pores here.
The skins of the back are <unk> with small <unk>
You act primarily like filter, the other mainly like barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there is no place, no <unk>
It's a system that goes gradually its functionality through the variation of <unk>
Here's a divided screen that represents my view of the world -- the twice personality of every designer and architect in working today between the <unk> and the gene between the machine and the organism, between assembly and the organism, between the assembly and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right hemisphere and the right hemisphere is shown in the two screens after me.
My work, in his simplest level, it tries to bring these two visions of the world, away from assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask why right now?
Why wasn't it possible that 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where they have four disciplines that offers to designers access to tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and my students' hands.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through large-scale scales, like this robotic arm with a reach of 24 meters in diameter with a <unk> basis that someday we did not very far to print buildings and <unk> and highly <unk> <unk>
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where every aperture is <unk> to model the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a fashion fashion fashion from Paris with <unk> they are <unk> It's like a second skin made from a single piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with 3D printing collaborator, we print this layer and 3D engagement between cells, and I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid and soft materials in the <unk> <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of an MRI scanner.
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical and the instruments of <unk> it allows us to design products that are <unk> not just the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair a chair to the comfortable structural and also being absorbed by sound.
The Carter teacher -- my collaborator, we went back to nature to <unk> and to design this <unk> surface pattern becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, like in nature, they vary its functionality not by addition to another material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> the material property.
But it's nature <unk>
There is no parts of nature?
I didn't grew up in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories about the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and actually define a lot of what I care about.
Like she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sending the Earth to grow a tree <unk> <unk>
For that first tree <unk> there would be no difference between extra -- branches, leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a piece of fruit.
Instead, the land made the trees grow up with branches, <unk> and flowers.
<unk> created a world made out of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would the design do if the objects were made out of a single part?
Put it at a better state of the <unk>
So we look for the <unk> material -- the kind of material of the tree is going with fruit, and we found it.
The second most abundant <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons produced every year because of organisms like shrimp, crab, <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we could tune their <unk> we could generate <unk> structures in a single piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> <unk>  We did a lot of seed husks -- the <unk> and we produced toothpaste.
We have chemical concentrations -- we've been able to get a wide range of <unk> from dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures that was built up a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made from a single 3.5 billion material -- 100 percent.
When the pieces are <unk> you dry them in order to find a natural way to contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to contain <unk> <unk> that appeared for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the bacteria engineered bacteria to capture carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without <unk> <unk> and if it broadens even more, to windows.
A single <unk> tree.
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made of <unk> of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best part: for objects designed for <unk> put in the sea, <unk> life and placed on the ground, they'll help grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration of the same principles of design was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to maintain the life for <unk>
To do that, we must master bacteria and control its flow.
So as the table board, we made our own table of items, new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology as the liquid <unk> only that instead of <unk> metals -- new <unk> -- biological <unk> into very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these agricultural crops <unk>
In our first piece of clothes, you know, two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the ponds of fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that live in the human intestine in the human brain.
One becomes light in sugar, the other is consumed sugar and produce biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, it's never been <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as an evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we have created a single channel that looks like <unk> tract -- that will help these bacteria flow and make it <unk> their function of path.
And so we started to grow those channels in the human body, we would have the properties of the material according to the functionality <unk>
If we wanted to be more <unk> they put more transparent channels.
This kind of laser system will come up when you stretch from one end to the other, it's 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our intestine thin.
And here it is, as <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> brilliant channels in your clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are cutting-edge creatures -- only half is <unk>
What if the design is going to <unk> the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin -- <unk> the damaged tissue and our <unk>
Think of this as a form of editing biology.
I call this the material ecology
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So for now, you know that a 3D printer print material.
You also know nature does not do this.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly <unk> architecture a home within which it was <unk>
<unk> <unk> is about this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, which are those fibers in each other.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first turned into the environment, creates a tension, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, become a single material.
In order to understand how this complex process works, attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the <unk> worm <unk>
And yet, by putting the silk worm into a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that they would <unk> a cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different layers and different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape -- the <unk> structure was transmitted directly through the environment.
Often the silk worms are going to death within their <unk> their silk <unk> and it is used in the <unk> industry.
We saw these templates can be shaped by raw silk without boiling a single <unk>
They were <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we scale this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making <unk> silk, and we put ourselves in our site.
We knew that silk worms will go into more dark areas and <unk> so we use a solar path diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat into our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat and heat with silk worms over the structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
We said, <unk> silk worms to a online farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready for us with us.
We put them carefully at the lower edge of the <unk> and as it was <unk> <unk> they were getting <unk> and the life begins again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
The biological silk silk about silk <unk> <unk> give all this pavilion its integrity.
And in a little bit more than two or three weeks, we have <unk> silk worms <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the <unk>
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other full metal text.
If the last frontier of design is to give the products and the buildings around us, to form a two material, designers should bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a design inspired by nature to a nature inspired by a nature inspired by design, which demands us for the first time, that we make us charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time.
You can stick with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be about <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be about <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had any interest, but I had a <unk>
In school I liked the English, the <unk> and the art and he was making websites and also playing the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard of us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But at the time this sense of art, this feeling of a lot, this feeling is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to move on.
But then I came up with something else, something totally different, and I was going to get myself into it, and I'm going to let me absorb and feel <unk> I've found the <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to move on.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern has got a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, to deny all of my own passions, and I would think about <unk>
Another reason why I had so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me for nothing.
I was worried about being afraid of engagement, or being dispersed, or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I would like to have stood up with.
Ask themselves, where did they learn to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where the <unk> you learned from culture.
And we asked the first question: "What do you want to be about <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what I was going to do.
It's considered a naive question to provoke answers to kids like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> of <unk> here.
This question is done again and again as we grow in various ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students ask them to be asked to choose the university.
And at some point, "What do you want to be about <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise from before it takes us the dream.
Why?
If this question inspires kids to dream of what they might be, doesn't inspire to dream of everything you might be.
In fact, it does exactly the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things -- although adults, they're going to be <unk> and say, "Oh, what are they cute, but you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor was converted into <unk> <unk> professor and <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that every one of us has something to do during your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is, and I will dedicate your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected in this way?
What if there are a lot of different themes that wake up with your curiosity and a lot of different things that wants to do?
There's no place for someone as one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feel like there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with many interests and creative activities.
Is it a breath, so say.
Could you help if it split up in three parts: multiple potential and <unk>
You can also use some other terms that you can see the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was who was <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as a <unk>
Would you hear any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems to me as a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or woe you should win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here are three superpowers <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creation of something new at the intersection.
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> his shared interests on cartography, visualization about data, travel, math and design, I started <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea for his <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
The innovation happens at intersections.
From there the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their background, can access a lot of these points of intersection.
The second superpower superpower superpower is learning fast.
When we <unk> it <unk> we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> for having been a lot of times in the past, and this means we have less afraid of testing new things and get out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to every new area that we have, so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a complete <unk> and independent writer <unk>
As a pianist who was a pianist who had an incredible capacity to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before he turned into a writer, <unk> was <unk>
He had to learn the most fine sales mechanics when their practices, and this skill helps to write compelling launches for the editors.
It rarely is a loss of time to go to what you would tell you, even if you end up with it.
You can apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower superpower is adaptability.  That is the ability to turn into anything that is needed in a given situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, other words designer designer, sometimes consultant of Kickstarter, sometimes master, and sometimes, apparently James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of their customers.
<unk> magazine defined adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can <unk> to meet the needs of the market that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, fast learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you could lose if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging people to believe themselves to themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative creative thinkers to address them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> <unk> knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you, either.
In fact, some of the best teams came up from a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep and put ideas, and the <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we all ought to design lives and careers that we need with the way we're connected.
And unfortunately, to the <unk> in a lot of them are encouraging them to simply be more like their <unk>
I once said that, if there's one thing that you take from this talk, I hope that's this: <unk> with internal <unk> whatever it is.
If you are a heart attack, then, <unk> for all the media.
That's where you will give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those you just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes --  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Follow his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
The intersections.
<unk> our internal <unk> leads us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most important, <unk> the world will be lost.
Thank you.
In <unk> a woman named <unk> led to a psychiatric in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of your life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but I was going to go through it until it was unfortunately passed away.
After his death, he did a <unk> and they found strange <unk> and <unk> in the brain of <unk> of a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If I had been alive today, we could not give her more aid than the one that he <unk> gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's.
From <unk> medicine has done a lot.
They have been discovered and antibiotics to protect ourselves from the infections, lots of treatments for cancer, <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and so much more.
But it has been made in the treatment of Alzheimer's.
I'm part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million across the world.
But by 2050, it's going to affect 150 million which, by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live up to the age of 85 or more, the chance to get Alzheimer's for almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the chance that you spend their years to have Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or wanted to be faced with Alzheimer's.
In America, Alzheimer's disease costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of the five dollars of health care takes for Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs to increase in five times by 2050, as we get older, the generation of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest medical challenges of our generation.
But it's done relatively little for <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 sources of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that can't be able to heal or even slow away its development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money on the research of the same.
The U.S. government spends 10 times every year in cancer research than Alzheimer's despite the fact that we have more Alzheimer's and causes a similar number of deaths from deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to one more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time you know, but all the world <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of the scientists, Alzheimer's Alzheimer's for aging.
We think we're going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you just have to look at a picture of a healthy brain, healthy compared to a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical harm caused by this disease.
In addition to putting a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's reduce the hope of life and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found <unk> and strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules today.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds as a origami.
There are places that are <unk>
And when it folds well, these dots will end up in the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some points are going on the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and identifying what step block is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do nothing.
You know, others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that we can get it, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of you have reduced the wires and waited for the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> physical chemicals, engineers, and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now it's testing a new kind of drugs that controls specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our latest results.
No one out of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at some videos from what happened to the test of these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move normally.
These maggots, the other side, they have protein molecules that are thrown into each other within them, like humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at a early stage, then we see that <unk> and they live a normal life.
This is just a positive outcome, but the research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to defeat Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to suggest that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we <unk> it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, the patients and their families have downloaded more research and <unk> pressure on governments, industry, drug industry and <unk>
That was essential to advance the treatment of HIV in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, are often too <unk> to go out and advocate for the change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimers is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change that they need for themselves.
They were talking about them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I published this article in the <unk> <unk> <unk> in January <unk> in January of this year.
In love with someone, do this.
The article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience of test it was one night last summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple: Two strangers are <unk> to get the <unk> more and more personal questions, and then they both look at your eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions here.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, which would be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you ever heard another person?
And <unk>
We <unk> these are getting more personal and more personal.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like to call it or it was very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you've ever met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a really detail really struck me about the piece that two of the participants had married six months later and invited everything from the lab to the ceremony.
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had the time to test this study, with somebody who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to <unk>
But I thought it was a good story, and so I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the red column we got a few months later.
That was published in January, and it's now in August, so I guess some of you will probably ask, and they are probably going to be asking you to go together.
And the reason I think you know, this is because I've done this question over and over again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to that.
A week before the article was published, I was very nervous.
I'd been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had taught me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog entry can get to a few hundred views of seen as a lot, and those were usually just my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably have a few thousand views.
And that has a good attention to a relatively new relationship.
But because I had no idea.
The paper was published on a Friday afternoon on Friday at night, and he stood up on my traffic trafficking.
And Sunday, the Sunday, I had called the Human "Today and the Good <unk> <unk>
In one month, the paper got over eight million <unk> and I was, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage trust writing with each other, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news --  and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called or write about what they did every day for weeks, they were the same question: still still go together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search for my email with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were students and journalists and strangers like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
But even I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately put red.
I think this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in a international day, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article <unk> for St. <unk> who included the experiences of readers to test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first impulse to all of this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said that not every petition that we both did a public emergence together.
I had a television interviews, and <unk> the orders of pictures of us two.
I think I was afraid to become the icons in the <unk> of the process of <unk> a range that I didn't feel at absolute <unk>
And I understand people didn't want to know only if the study was working, they wanted to know if it really <unk> I mean, if it was able to produce love -- not just an adventure, but love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, especially people made the wrong question.
How do you know if you were going together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would do the experience of doing these 36 questions at least interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there the research goal was not to produce romantic love.
Instead of that, I was looking to foster interpersonal approach among college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
That sounds romantic isn't it?
But the study did work.
The participants felt closer after doing this. Several later studies, they were also used to <unk> protocol <unk> as a quick way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and the community, and they've used it to be used between people of opposite political ideologies people.
The original version of history, which I tested last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this paper, but unfortunately never <unk>
A few months ago, I was giving a talk on a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, you want to tell you that you love the person who is <unk>
Well he made a break.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I said, but became better friends?
They were able to get them better after testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it's love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29 and I was going through a really hard <unk>
I had had that relationship since I had 20, which was largely all of my adult life, and he was my first true love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I went into the science.
So I did all I was able to find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that could be a certain way to get the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought that I just research for the book I was writing but in hindsight, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was obsessed with romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and I used to feel like I sat then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or a different way.
I'm more patient with love, I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what I'm after.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably <unk> me.
What I'm looking for love is a guarantee -- not just to be <unk> today and being beloved tomorrow, but they will keep being beloved indefinitely by the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that people ask when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media talked about at the 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to mitigate some way to mitigate something of the risk -- and this is a very scary story, because they love us to feel <unk> but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that he says, still together?
And their content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, would suggest that we ask more difficult questions, questions like, how you decide who deserves your love and who not?
How do you stay in love when things are <unk> and how to get to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with the uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or more, how do you live with the doubt of your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more thoughtful conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of my own relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known and I was applying a study designed to create romantic love, we are still following together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love it's not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my journal <unk> The love didn't happen.
<unk> fell in love because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit when I read it now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, there was no thought everything I was supposed to was that choice.
I didn't know how many times we would have both of the ones that make that decision, and how much it will have to continue to do that choice without knowing before he is always choice or not.
I want it enough to have done and responded 36 questions, I would have chosen to love someone as generous, kind and kind of fun and have expressed that choice in the largest daily newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really do.
And so what I think about and what I may spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I actually didn't see.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose to love someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's <unk> but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by some lesbian in full mountain, and I sort of got a little bit of a forest <unk>
 something that really affected me a time.  Something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'm going to start with when I was eight years old.
So I took a wooden box and they <unk> a dollar ticket a pen and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some kind of weird <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it's a grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment he was given in <unk> <unk> like to go from <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and all those things <unk> and I was doing a homework for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and made a kind of <unk> <unk> to the style of Agnes Martin, I wrapped them in <unk> and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I put more resin on the canvas, thinking that I could <unk>
Instead, it happened the opposite: in some way it seemed to increase the size -- as if it was that they were playing the text with a <unk>
So I did I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding electronic elements, and we put strange bottles that was finding out the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to figure out and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God I can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> just like you do about a body on the crime scene.
And I pulled out the objects and created my own taxonomy of individuals <unk>
First of all, you can make sure you can get an idea.
Then I did some insects and insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to bring my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great, man.
At some point, I became interested in the human form, sculptures of natural size with drawings of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing:
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
And I started drawing in the glass layers -- similar to drawing in a window, then in another window and another window, and I had all these windows together that formed a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really works, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big -- I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by a lot in "The <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting in the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
Five feet long.
It has double a face, so it's 10 feet <unk>
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animals are travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of <unk> to this <unk> mesh of <unk>
So here is where creatures with animals are headed to the <unk> lists for <unk> <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> are all kinds of weird things that can be found if you look very well in the ocean.
But anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand comes out of it.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems to be mythological to keep the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a little bit a little bit.
That's the hand that we <unk>
And then, when you go on the other hand, it has a <unk> like a bird <unk> and it spits out clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that joins the <unk>
Anyway, his tail turn on fire on a <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why I did that.
Things that go out, you know.
His tail ends up in an eye of <unk> made out of 1986.
They've been <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of the terrorists.
Pretty <unk> over time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a <unk> project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a file of our culture, through media and material and material is <unk> dictionaries or magazine.
But each one acts as a kind of file in a form of human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, they divide up.
And you can walk between them. I'm getting years old.
Each one is basically a <unk> microscope that weighs 1.3 pounds with a human being trapped inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest, you can <unk> the <unk>
I'm going to show you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and you cover the penis or <unk> or whatever you have -- a kind of thing <unk>
It's a refresher in these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a game in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and come into the head of this strange <unk>
There's a little scene in the forest inside the <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these guys, like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a <unk> it's called <unk> <unk>
In this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a musician, one of the radio, a museum, a school, an editorial arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world and a garden.
<unk> the box and all of the people inside hits each other like particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you get older, who is and the box that it's living in.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, of the borders, of religion, it doesn't work.
We're all very facts about the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But for this pill to have an effect on pain, first of the stomach, the bowels and other organs.
And I'm going to take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system, so that any drug will effect on the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take drugs -- they serve it to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and to increase the tissue of <unk> cells.
But they are also known for their side effects <unk> in their majority of negative, because in the time that it takes to get to the current side, you will be <unk> and worse even over the time that it takes to get to its fate, which is where it's most important, in the waste of HIV.
These are regions of the body like the <unk> <unk> the nervous system, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the blood stream of patients who are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs, which is a treatment of <unk> life <unk>
One day, I sat down, and I thought, <unk> I could get the treatment directly to the <unk> of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientific scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it to be used to care of wounds and surgery for diabetes, they can be used for anything <unk> including transportation of drugs.
In fact, we're already using pulses of laser pulses to open or drill into extremely small, <unk> holes that open and close to immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
They ask the best people to say, "How is that <unk>
We sent a little bit of and potent laser over the cellular membrane of the bacterial cell -- while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, as the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of <unk>
Before you even realize, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro technology, or on <unk> plates, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a device in three heads.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll make a <unk> on the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, it goes to the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> which is <unk> it releases it directly to the site of infection, as the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't look a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all research researcher in our case, a <unk> treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I have studied armed groups, not <unk> armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
Do you know what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence and study ways to encourage the transition from violent participation to the confrontation of violent <unk>
I work on the field, in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solve almost everything conflict, because war has changed.
It used to be a dispute among states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between the states and actors.
For example, of the <unk> peacekeeping deals between 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and an non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even need to be <unk> or <unk> in any process of life resolution.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do, but no one does not look at what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and political policies are <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global view.
<unk> groups are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for his violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also set a political game, a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks, against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza from 2007.
So these groups make more than simply shooting.
<unk>
They put a complex piece of communication stations, radio channels of TV, websites and Internet websites and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the print magazine in English and published to <unk>
The armed groups also invest in a complex fundraising fund without <unk> but by example, through <unk> <unk> for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to get better and build their brand.
<unk> groups also make something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, running hospitals, they run a professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
<unk> groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state is not preventing security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in an Afghanistan is driven by war, or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> can also be understood by the efforts of these groups for delivering safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a price higher for the population.
But in general, to provide social services means filling a vacuum, a <unk> gap by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral electoral of 2006 of Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage, even in the West, when we look at groups <unk> we just think of the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill gaps from the government, and emerge as armed and political groups, engage in violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated the <unk> are these organizations, we can less <unk> it as opposed to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a territory, running all of their <unk> collect the trash, running the <unk> system.
It's an state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, in the state of the state and hybrids and the weakest of them are states, like in the Middle East -- the more fixed and fill that gap actors.
This is important to governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in the military tools.
You know, that empty government has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If we understand the better we understand groups that are going to understand what incentives to offer the transition from violence to the violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors are not able to <unk> the military power can make some <unk> but we don't give us peace and stability.
To achieve these goals targets we need long-term investments to fill that vacuum of security, to fill that empty government vacuum that allowed these groups to thrive in a beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a failure like a woman and a feminist.
My views on gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid accepting the label <unk> would be unfair for the <unk>
I'm a feminist, but pretty bad.
And so I had a bad feminist.
Or, at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> and then in interviews -- people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself, and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and at the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about <unk> these women who were <unk> <unk> with the men and they hated sex.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, it seems a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that might be a feminist.
It will be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a word taboo and nasty.
I <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, he asks too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe it's equal or higher to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I grew up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
It was the same paycheck for the same job.
We have a right to travel around the world like <unk> free or violence.
We have a right to use easy and accessible the contraceptives and financial services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> controls or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have in account our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social condition, and skills and much more.
We have to have in account of these differences and how we behave in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear, I'm a disaster.
I'm full of <unk>
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive to work, I listen to rap music at all volume.
Although the letter degrades women and <unk> deeply, the classic <unk> <unk> from the Yin yang <unk> is incredible.
Do you actually show your shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you hit the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely upset by my musical experience.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk>  all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the <unk> of the grass and the maintenance of <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
It makes the fashion magazines and the nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies in the fairy tales that make it happen.
Some of my crime are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of his husband, is his choice, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay at home to raise their children, I would have that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that the women are economically vulnerable when they <unk>
Let's take this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism who has ignored the needs of the women of color, the workers, gay workers, gay women and <unk> in favor of white women, middle-class <unk>
And if that's good feminism is a very bad feminist <unk>
It also happens to be this: As a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we can play perfection.
When we were going to give you the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I think I was a <unk> of that <unk> before I try to put up there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative innovative and leaders are afraid to be tagged as <unk>
They are afraid of standing up and say, "Yeah, I'm a <unk> for fear of what that tag is -- so that we can't be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get to the slightly realistic expectations.
Let's take an example to <unk> or like I call it.
In the last few years it's a feminist <unk>
In 1,200 Music 2014, <unk> in front of the word <unk> in front of the word <unk>
It was a <unk> show to see this star in the pop star openly feminism and to know women and young men who will be a feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics began the endless arguments if they were <unk> it was or not just a feminist.
They would bring up their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection of <unk> because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much we need so much.
We go much beyond the sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> feminism from any woman -- <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
The bad feminism, or more inclusive feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to the day, will go to action and be a little bit more brave.
If I listen to music, I'm creating a demand for artists that would be happier that would be happier than happy to provide an supply of them.
These artists are not going to change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> change their profits.
It certainly is hard.
Why does their music have to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions are justify this makes it more difficult for women to get the equality, equality that we all deserve to do, and it's our responsibility.
I think of my three and four years.
It's two and <unk> <unk> <unk> and very brave. I want to grow in a world.
where they were being told by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of it, all of a sudden, the best choice is going to be solved as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is treating sexual violence against women like sport, <unk> the <unk>
We can change the radio block when we hear songs that treat women as anything.
We can spend our money to go to film in another part when movies don't treat women more than as <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting the professional sports sports where athletes treat their peers as <unk>
In any case, men, especially male white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish her magazine to participate in his project, or to work with you, until it doesn't include a number enough number of women, both to participate in how to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but we're going to be able to participate in this kind of projects, we can also encourage us to be even more like us to overcome the barriers to the decision <unk>
Because we are not <unk> <unk> without these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our achievements will mean very little.
We can make these little acts of courage and expect our decisions to get to the top, to the people in the power and movie producers and music film and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, and significant.
We can also argue with courage -- good, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> is going to be a bad feminist will not be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I tell you, especially because I <unk> my voice was stolen to me and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to address what happened.
A few guys told me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after all I didn't bother to believe that I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and they understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through the writing and feminism, I also found out that if I was a little brave, another woman could hear and see that none of us is nothing that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I have the fact that I do is that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I am a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little courageous, when you need to be such a <unk>
Just after Christmas of last year, <unk> children in California had measles because we had visited <unk> or because of being exposed to somebody who had been there.
The virus then went across the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the cool things about this outbreak is that measles is that the measles that may be lousy for a child with an immune immune system is one of the most easily <unk> diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for over half a century ago, but many of the children involved in the outbreak -- they had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly <unk> the autism.
But a moment, was not the article that include the argument about autism and vaccines and <unk> and marked by being a fraud <unk> by British Medical <unk>
It doesn't believe the majority of smart scientists that the theory that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents all around the world are still <unk> that vaccines will put in danger to their children to have autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the <unk> estimates of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and <unk> that I'd heard about she believed to develop their whole life without seeing one case.
For decades, the estimates of prevalence had stable only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the '90s, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> fundraising as <unk> <unk> is referred to autism as an epidemic as an epidemic as if I could get away from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people about the Centers for Disease Control which is going on, what is going on, tend to be based on phrases like <unk> of diagnostic diagnosis, and a better detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who searches for his son of two years, the eye contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to figure out why they were so <unk> by the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow and slow progress in the science that with the sort of sense of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism is, and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same is having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism than had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story starts with an infant psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital.
They could have fun for hours by waving their hands in front of their faces, but they were prey to <unk> as when they didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
Over the base of the patients in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the decade of 1950, as the main authority of the world in the subject, stated that I had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as the <unk> of places as far as South Africa.
This is actually no wonder, because the criteria for the diagnosis of autism were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to children with <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once you get rid of that he had become nine of every 10 children sent out of other doctors to her office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart, but part of his theories weren't <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of child <unk> caused by cold parents, and <unk>
These kids, he said, they have been carefully kept in a fridge that we don't know.
At the same time, though, <unk> noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that they put together in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the children in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I turned the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records -- he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills -- stating things like the children were simply <unk> what they had heard their parents were desperate to win their <unk>
As a result, autism became a source of embarrassment for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, turning them into the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s, that researchers started testing the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist thought that the theory of mothers from <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John was warm people and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a child as no support, no special education, without special education, no special education, no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To stand for the National Foreign Service, that they needed more resources for autistic kids, and their families, their colleague, Judith Gould decided to do something that should be done 30 years before.
They launched a study of prevalence in the general population.
I took a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find children autistic children in the community.
What you saw was that the model of <unk> was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse and diverse ones.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination with the astrophysics, or the <unk> of the <unk>
In other ways, these kids didn't fit in beautiful frames and <unk> like <unk> and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How no one had no <unk> of these kids before?
But then I came up with a reference to a paper published in German <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then he turned down, buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> in his own work.
Not even one translation of English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> spoke German, and he translated it for her.
The document provides an alternative history of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a school school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for teaching children are <unk> even for the <unk> standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music exercises with music, and the kids followed their games for the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as as a disability <unk> of life that required <unk> and <unk> <unk> spaces throughout the course of life.
Instead of treating the children in their clinic as patients, and he called them their little teachers, and he started to help in the developing methods of education that were especially suited for them.
<unk> Asperger's saw autism as a continuum of diverse and a staggering array of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they have always been, seeing aspects of this continuous <unk> known in the pop culture like the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say that for success in science and art, a hint of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith figured out that <unk> was wrong when autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
In the late 1980s and early '90s, their changes came into <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by a broad <unk>
These changes don't fell into <unk>
<unk> when I was <unk> and Judith were working with each other, to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before he came out of <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism was, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and the recognition of <unk> <unk> with four awards of <unk> <unk> psychologists, teachers and fathers from everybody knew what the autism was.
At the same time, there was the first very easy clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I should no longer have a connection to that little circle of experts to achieve a diagnosis for her son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnostics began to <unk> the same way they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they hoped that it was so that we were hoping that the people with autism and their families will finally support the support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> got to blame vaccines for the increase in diagnosis. A very powerful, powerful story -- and <unk> credible story as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the center of prevention that one of every 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, they're right, autistic autistic are one of the largest <unk> groups in the world.
In the last few years, autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that they're the puzzles for solving by the new advances -- doctors, <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way of understanding <unk> is to think in terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a attention deficit <unk>
Certainly autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching into <unk> that I believed that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are in people's understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, communities of support, and parents in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman called <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of <unk>
As we go into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence forms on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
